It is taking time to get used to this os and functions. Specification wise it's a good laptop with good hardware. Smooth to operate and very useful for miling and reading docs. We need to invest extra for ma office and other apps. ####   Cute ##  trendy ##  sleek added with good performance ####   256GB expandable memory is true or just a joke? I've recieved the chrome book but cannot find any slot for the memory card ####   Perfect for students....screen quality is good....can run almost all useful apps & softwares....(not .exe files) ####   So far ##   it has been phenomenal and earmarked to all the functionality. Though the trackpad is a bit draggy as compared to the other high end laptops ##  but one can smoothly function using the touch screen instead. ####   Currently for my work i am using i7 8th gen with 8gb ram that one take 1min around. This hp one boots in 4-5 seconds. Using from 5days so i don't have comprehensive review. ####    Touchscreen is awesome ####   I am requesting you and warning you all please never buy any kind of hp laptop it's totally worst product I have ever purchased ##  totally waste of my many and have bad experience with cust care service..i used lenovo which thousand times better than hp..if you have budget go for dell ####   Worst product ##  don't purchase if you want this for office use. This is a useless product ##   more like a tab. I purchased it for my office work and its of no use. And the irony is amazon is not allowing me to return this. ####   I dont like this cromebook ...this totally worst ####   Best choice for online classes. Fast boot decent performance ####   Very good product ####   This is great laptop for all day to day tasks. I like the performance you get at this configuration. You can do pretty much everything on this. The battery is awesome ##  you can use it for 7-8 hrs without power. I have got this for my daughter for which she is using for college and study purpose. I am seriously planning to shift to chromebook for my next laptop for all work purpose. Thumb's up. ####   You have to dig deep to just to verify if it's the ancient 720p/ 768p display or today's minimum needed 1080p display. There's barely any phone less than 1080p now ####   this is not at all good for reading even pdf word file etc...it is too slow ####   Didn’t start. HP service Center is asking to return but no return option on Amazon ####   Screen quality very bad ####   Buy according to use not useful for office use ####   These are my first impressions about the product ####   My humble request is everyone ##  don't buy this laptop ##  it's waste of money ##  not at all useful for daily routine ##  they are not giving refund or exchange. Think thousand times before buy ####   After reading all the reviews ##  thought of giving it a try and I had mixed feelings. Here are my observations. ####   Bad ####   Never Buys HP products because their technical team has 0 knowledge about their products and they always give stupid reasons .......... Also they transfer call to one another saying they will solve but you will never get solution... not only this they will say you about call back which you will never get and at last they themself say why did you buy the hp product... ####   Chromebook does not allow you to sideload apps from storage. ####   This Chromebook is sturdy with good battery life for normal usage. There was little finishing issues at back panel but it is something not noticeable. I have used it mostly for browsing and faced no issues as such with performance. Touch scree is good by considering the price of this product but it is not comparable with high end devices. ####   This product is not a laptop but seller by Amazon in laptop category ##  which is a fraud. I have purchased for my father as a laptop ##  but it is a android tab with keypad and no option for return. ####   Buy this laptop and don't go for all the \"PADS\". This is as good as a full blown laptop. Excellent sound ##  Browsing speed ##  Screen Sharing etc. ####   This is a total waste of money.. If the seller can get in touch and exchange it for a windows/office usable laptop ##  it will be very helpful.. ####   Good product but colour is not as thought. ####   This is chromebook and not laptop. ####   The chromebook is good the battery life is also good but the viewing angles are not that good although the price is reasonable. ####   But  ##  the worst class of Touch screen and too worst quality display  ##  it was broken within month of purchase only push some pressure when closing ##  ####   *Pros*: ####   Good product ##  best for my daily office work. But you need to buy MS office seperately. ####   Its a pathetic office use laptop ##  unable to run MS Office on it... pls change it... really suffering after buying it. ####   Its good for student useful and lightweight comfortable ####   You like everything about this computer. The only thing in case you want to use multiple Chrome browser like you can do on windows you won't be able to do that. ####   Laptop is not working ####   Everything is good but my Chromebook is not supporting GOOGLE PLAY STORE and It doesn't have 3 port in it. Only one USB port is in it. ####   Do not purchase items from HP. After sale service is very bad. Even though my chromebook is still in warranty they don't care to response  the complian and repair. ####   Fast. Good battery backup. Poor quality camera. Screen not so good. ####   Very bad quality products manufacturered by HP ####   Bought this in March 2021. Stopped working in a few days. ####   Okay ##  as a tech enthusiast ##  I've been looking for a Chromebook for a while and after doing some research ##  I narrowed down to this. ####   I have purchased this product and have to return for touch issue and their enginer told that this product should be replaced and I have received full refund ####   You can't see side view/video of screen ##  looks shabby from different angles ##  it's not HD too...you see clear video when you are exact opposite to laptop screen. Touch and Cam is not up to the mark. I Suggest to go for windows laptop with same budget. ####   Overall good for normal browsing and online classes...not for heavy work. ####   You will either end up replacing or install windows 10 which is next to impossible. ####   Very good product. Some issues with wifi on boot. Screen really sensitive (needs screen gaurd) ####    Battery is low cals ####   Do NOT get fooled by the negative reviews ##  it’s a great laptop! ####   I like it. ####   The product was old and used one it's camera not working it touchpad not working ##  their was no warranty card and use manual ####   Dislike ####   if they able to add backlight feature on keyboard it would more awesome ####   Laptop is sleek and fast. It is lightweight and thin. ####   It's lagging so much ####    Product is good no doubt but it's advice not to buy from here as the product warranty is mismatched and the invoice and warranty slip provided do not contain product serial number .So there will be warranty issue  ## hp will not provide any warranty without invoice having product serial number.So be careful. ####   Writing this after 2 months of use. Was looking for laptop for family use and kids online classes. While researching realized that chromebook was best option ##  as all household workflow is through browser anyways. No point in getting bloated windows OS ##  when only thing we do is use chrome. Had decided to go with Duet ##  but since kid wanted a bigger screen ##  went for this HP chromebook.. And boy ##  once I got it ##  realized it was best decision. Thankfully did not go for Duet ##  as I realized having many ports are important and convenient for home use. ####   I like this but the camera is not good ####   Screen quality not good... ####   Nice touchscreen with good display. Battery is also performing well. ####   Good for surfing only. No use if you are working on powerpoint and excel sheets . ####   Product is not good. Getting struct video with zoom app ####   It's like working on your mobile phone but without internet. I bought this for my daughter's online classes ##  the internet keeps dropping off. When downloaded teams ##  it doesn't open in that too. The keys are also not working properly. I asked to return this but that option is also not there. Please don't buy this at all. ####   Best product for student and gives amazing experience and sound is also amazing ####   Laptop is good slim lite weight. But i received a defected one. Touchpad was not working properly. Finally returned my laptop. ####   its just perfect for students .....only u need a wifi to work with it which means only a wifi person can use this....otherwise its the most immaculate thing on earth .....hehehe ####   This is the best budget friendly chromebook. Touch screen  ##  sound  ##  video quality is pretty good. Battery life is good . As the processor is entry level it may not be suitable for heavy Multi tasking jobs. ####   Only for browsing and watching movies ##  best for student online classes ##  not at all used for office work. Just like a android tab with keyboard. Windows OS users please make sure to double check before buying there is no return policy ##  I bought it for office use and now using for kids online classes 😔 ####   Battery life is good ##  2days I use it for 6 hours a day. It's touch screen. Android experience on laptop. You can have all apps that you use on mobile ##  but many apps doesn't support wide screen. Chrome browser is also a basic desktop version ##  not fully customisable as desktop version. U can use opera as it supports chromebook and works as desktop version. Display is not good. You need to adjust brightness accronding to the time.  You can access to linux ##  and that is also a basic version. No Coding. Not for students. Can be used by students upto 12th class. ####   The best part of the laptop is the boot time and easy of navigation making it very customer friendly ####   Not working products  ##  pls do not buy  ##  no warrenty  ##  tottally cheated Amazon ####   Worst product without windows better to buy a pad than a laptop ####   My first Chromebook purchase. I wasn't sure how the shift from windows is going to be. But Chrome OS is great - quick ##  smooth ##  safe and very light on processor and battery. ####   Light weight good laptop for everyday use ##  especially for students. ####   Poor quality . The lcd screen has stopped working. Even bigger issue is the way HP has handled the service request- poor response time coupled with poor technical understanding of solving the issue ####   I have been using it for 4 months ##  its my secondary device. ####   Worst product to buy and you can't return. Useless product... waste of money... can't use for office work so shocked that how amzone can categories this in laptop list... ####   Best option to buy ####   This product was very poor and please no buy no cloud storage this is very poor service by hp and Amazon seller service ####   This is not a SSD hard disk.  It is EMMC. The description is misleading. ####   Good ####   brand new product with 2-3 dark patches on screen. ####   I am not at all satisfied with the product as well as the customer service... The size mentioned over here is 14 inches whereas I have received a 12 inch screen size chromebook and they are not able to find any solution to get in touch with the client ####   One of the worst laptops I have ever used. I seriously doubt it why they call it a laptop. Its total waste. ####   It is a laptop without being a laptop. Precisely ##  don't buy it to save money because you would repent. Even when you buy a licensed Office 365 and install it ##  there are numerous utilities which doesn't function. List is numerous. To cite just one if you are using Zoom ##  you can't record the proceedings. Once you start using it ##  you would realise what a waste of money. Pl pl don't invest in this product. ####   Everything was good awesome to use but CD drive only missing ####   Nice product…loved it’s"},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS VivoBook 15 (2020) 15.6-inch (39.62 cms) FHD ##  Intel Core i3-10110U 10th Gen ##  Thin and Light Laptop (4GB/1TB HDD/Office 2019/Windows 10/Integrated Graphics/Silver/1.9 Kg) ##  X509FA-EJ311TS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹48 ## 990.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹16 ## 000.00 (33%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available.

It was a huge follow up after which the refund was made after a rigorous follow up of 20 days. ####   Superb battery life. Performance also is very good in terms of responsiveness. ####   Very good quality work. Well designed and far better than Dell and other laptops. I am hardcore Fan of Apple. ####   All MBP from 2016 suffers from design defect and the display will wear off after 2 years of purchase. Bad quality of Macbooks. Search “Flexgate” or “Stagelight” issue on google you will know how bad the problem with macbooks is. My MBP is now a trash. ####   The best laptop anyone can get in the market ####   Pleeeezzzz don't buy this laptop if your a hard-core windows user because most/all Intel apps do not support this laptop and most of the apps which are good need to be bought. ####   Best in class quality & features. I was windows user but after working on mac ##  my experience was superb. It’s very fast. Build quality is also best in class. I switched from HP Spectre X360. Macbook is better than spectre. Go for it🤗 ####   Next level stuff! ####   one of the best laptops I have used till now ##  13 inch feels just the right size. Premium built quality and love the smooth Mac OS. It`s expensive though ##  wish apple would price it better. ####   had to fix some issue with wifi drivers ##  other than that works well ####   If you use this laptop ##  no other laptop in the world will as good as this. ####   I desire to buy this MacBook. However ##  shortage of money. How do I earn money to buy this MacBook ? If you don’t want to help Then please stop stop posting this MacBook ad on the social media . I’m craze of MacBook . ####    Ultimate Product ##  awesome screen ##  battery is too powerful.  Value for Money.  Must buy if money doesn't matter. ####   Excellent ####   N'thing ####   Perfect laptop for developers. I'm upgrading from MacBook Air 2015 and this machine is 5 times faster! My webpack build used to take 200 seconds and this takes less than 40 seconds! Extremely powerful and efficient for my work. ####   I had a macbook ##  now i have a gaming laptop. yes i prefer the gaming laptop. you should too. but the battery is better on macbook. ####   Liked & it is used for Python program and others which is very good & easy to operate. ####   The premium product for a productive life. ####   This happens quite randomly and I couldn't take a photo as it just flicker and restarts. After restart there is option to report issue which I did but nothing changed. Also the laptop gets heated alot when used for prolonged hours and I sometimes need to restart it manually to improve performace. Really disappointed after spending so much money for this product. I am not able to get any support ##  please help. ####   Its been a month we are using this laptop and it performs very well for our daily activities. Just that screen keeps finger prints and smudges ##  hard to clean. ####   Dont waste your time seeing the reviews in youtube ##  just have it! You will never ever turn back to Windows. ####   Bought for my son. As usual apple product looks and feels premium without doubt. Screen quality is awesome. Just helped my son in the first time setup ##  he has iPhone too ##  both syncs effortlessly. ####   Gets turned off when I play any music ##  problem using internal speakers ##  and now it gets switched on automatically when I fold and pack the laptop in bag. Sometimes it gets switched off if I play songs without connecting earphones... It is very bad product I must say ##  not worth value for money as well.  Heating problem when connected to charger. Charger heating problem as well... Heating problem is when I use OBS for streaming...!!! ####   This is the best and productive laptop that I’ve ever used. This is amazing. ####   Excellent Laptop. ####   MacBook is the ultimate choice need to handle it carefully specially the Retina screen ####   M1 is a beast...apple has nailed it! best laptop at this price ##  by far!

Super laptop ##  brilliant experience..!! ####   Mac book pro m1 is an awesome apple product. I love the battery backup. It does not have heating issues like other lap top. Overall wonderfull experience so far ####   The laptop is light and sleek ##  but after just couple of months usage ##  the laptop satrted giving mild shock when connected to charger. ####   Sometimes it lags  ##  cursor moves slowly  ##  battery life is amazing  ##  faster boot up  ##  audio quality okiesh ####   It's a good macbook. I expected the new M1 chip to be something unique ##  but it's nice. It's been a month since I bought and there have been issues like black screen ##  printer setup issues ##  machine getting slightly warmer (claim is excellent cooling but it sometimes doesn't work well) ##  screen tends to attract lot of dust. All in all ##  it's a good buy but what one expects from Apple is way more :-) ####   I am using macbook pro for over 2 years now ##  and here is my suggestion to anyone who is considering to buy one. Go for a macbook only if you have deep pockets because even a small repair will cost you big amount of money. My macbook's battery now needs a replacement after 2 years of usage and the charge cycle has just reached 129 out of 1000 ##  and they service center guys says it will cost me Rs 40 ## 000 to get the battery replaced because its attached to the top cover of my laptop which will also be replaced. ####   I have MacBook Air (Intel Processor) now I bought MacBook Pro (M1) ##  with M1 it's a great machine. Battery life is excellent. ####   Loved it ####   Good laptop for work ##  battery backup is fine. I think the screen could have been more Bezel-less. Everything else is fine. ####   The camera and touch tab stopped working within 4 months of purchasing the machine. No support or replacement available. Certainly not worth to invest in this machine just for the performance ##  better machines are available in the market at much cheaper rates. Wait for the more evolved models. ####   Everything is Great and only dis-satisfied is we have to buy a type-c hub LOL :) ####   You won't regret buying any Apple's product. ####   I received a faulty piece and after few hours of usage it started flickering and sometime black screen. There is issue in the keyboard as well. ####   Hi All ##  I purchase MBP in beginning of August 2021 after single day I realised that lower panel of laptop cabinet is not capable to hold the weight of this machine. When I tried to pick it the lower panel (where the rubber are hinged) pressing in and touches the internal hardware. I have experienced that the body is pressing inside approx 1 or 2mm like a this Tin box. After that I went to local Apple Store and check the same machine but didn't experience anything like that. Second thing Apple Macs should be open by only single hand but day by day it is very difficult to open the led by even both hands. I can expect if little more time goes I might not open the LED of this machine ##  if I give more force than LED may break down. I can't expect this thing from Apple Macs. ####   Nodoubt its good in term of every possible way but service after warranty ll make u cry thats for sure  ##  macbook user since 2009 but now anyissue after warranty ll cost atleast 60 thousand . ####   Using this since last month. The machine is good and the speed is far better than the previous apples. Adobe and other heavy softwares opens within 3 seconds. It’s awesome. Only thing I should have purchased 16 inches screen however this works fine. ####   Works like a magic. The performance and battery life exceeded my expectations. Go for it guys! ####   my M1 MacBook Screens cracking for No REASON and saw many people complaining about the same please don't buy ####   The laptop is very cool and working nice. The charger wire was very cheap and you could see the white colour dust on my hand. It will not long last. Also the laptop cutting edge is too sharp. I am getting mark on my hand while using. It may harm when you forcefully or accedentally falling on it. Cost is also slightly high for this china assembled product. I think the repairing cost is also high. ####   Battery life is not as mentioned. Rest as expected. ####   This is an amazing product and amazon is also giving an amazing disscount on it. the actual price on apple's site is nearly 1 lakh 22 thousand but here you are getting it for 1 lakh 7 thousand! 15 thousand rupees disscount! Plus you also get the exchange offer! I haven't bought this macbook but I will surely buy it for my coding and 3D sclulpting work. ####   Everything is gud but it’s just been 1 month and I wish I could return. ####   There is always great hype about Apple products and most of the time they are true but not the same with apple laptop ####   One end point sopporter automatically going to crack during opening and closing of device. ####   What a speed!! ####   One of best Laptop for developers and creative professionals.Although I would suggest to go for 16GB model of Apple MBP M1. ####    Very good product ##  battery life more than expected ##  boots in no time ##  ease of operation. Webcam picture quality disappointing. ####   Absolute masterpiece! ####   The product is nice but I would suggest to hold till it comes to your budget. This price in amazon falls like stock market. 20 days back I bought this at 1.2 lakh and bow it is 1.07 lakhs😡😡 ####   Battery life is less than they say ####   I have the m 1 x chip macbook now that know  one has that 1 x chip macbook limited edition macbook from tecnical guruji ####   As expected from Macbook Pro M1 ##  excellent having in possession both iMac 2021 and Macbook Air 2017. Battery life is exceptional. Speaker sound is clear but not very loud. Display being 2K is pleasure to look at. I find touchbar useful in certain context. Everything else is great. More and more apps are getting native M1 support and this trend will continue. ####   No Commens ####   Excellent screen quality ##  Better battery life. Lags when you are copying data to a external Hard disk and also when you are importing photos from your iphone. For the rest ##  be assured ##  apple will not let u down. Apple has made this machine to give you different experience than other laptops. RAM could have been more ##  lagging is the result of that much short memory. ####    Feel like awesome. ####   The Retailer is awesome and product was box packed and perfect so far. Packing was excellent and it was in good shape . Hope the quality persists. ####   Hiting problem ####   Likes: ####   Good buy!! Been using for over a month!! Loving it! ####   good ####   Good overall ####   I have been using Apple products since a decade now and have never faced any issues with them. ####   Very good product bit costly but it's well and value for money I pitched it for online classes and it's perfect ####   Best investment ever. ####   The M1 MacBook Pro is a different beast altogether. Superior performance in terms of Graphics rendering ##  app opening and system turn on and most importantly Out of the world battery life. The thermal performance is way better than the intel chips based MacBook pros  ##  despite playing Graphics intensive games (Asphalt 9) while copying files from an external hard drive  ##  still didn’t trigger the fans to go high speed … so far a great experience. Only wish it came in 16\" screen size ####   I am reviewing after 2 month use -Its value of money 💸. ####   Being a dedicated Apple user since 2011 ##  there really was no \"selling\" required for me to make this decision. My primary machine was a 3.5 year old Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 that server me well and through more than normal usage. It survived rigorous pic/video editing ##  live-streaming and other multimedia heavy activities but had gotten worn down. Simply because it was the best fit for those kinds of jobs. ####   Product is undoubtedly good. But if you are a developer and you run apps like android studio and Xcode then consider 16gb ram. 8 gb ram is sometimes not sufficient and it is not upgradable. Also with new os updates apple products seem to become slower so more ram will be helpful to maintain speed in future. ####   Overall good product ####   ❤️❤️I loved it ...❤️❤️ ####   Screen quality excellent ####   Awesomeness ####   Very good product"},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 Processor 14 inches HD Laptop ##  8GB/512GB SSD/Windows 10/MS Office (Natural Silver/1.46Kg) ##  14s-dq2535TU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹63 ## 179.50", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹8 ## 189.50 (13%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": "₹54 ## 990.00", "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available* Disclaimer-*The Windows 11 upgrade will be delivered late 2021 into 2022.

Really disappointed! ####   Good laptop light weight battery life is good also ####   I am using before 5 month this leptop is very goog and for programer and also computer science student ####   This HP product comes with a lot of features apart from the great Brand. Powerful processor ##  good graphics ##  preloaded office ##  lightweight 14\" screen ##  back lit keyboard ..... all at a very competitive price ####   Super product and good service by amazon. Exchange is easy. ####   Such a worst product it's generating more heat And getting sound. I would like to return it ####   Laptop is good no doubt. But very disappointed with the packing. The laptop box seems wet from inside and outside as well. And we are worried that if it was wet from inside then it may cause a harm to laptop in future. ####   Very light in weight. compatible and looks elegant Value for money ####    All ok in this laptop I am using this from 12 days. No issues. I am recommending you this laptop ####   Sound Speakers and Keypads are Not upto the Money paid. Speed is Awesome as it's SSD. Picture quality extremely good. ####   A very good product for student ####   Okay to buy in 58k. ####   It's a really nice laptop for this price which comes with 8gb ram and 512 ssd. The boot up speed is insanely fast ( approx 7 sec) thanks to ssd. No heating issue till 2 weeks of usage. Speakers aren't the loudest but it's good enough for watching movies and YouTube. I was quite skeptical about the display quality before purchasing it but however I was surprised with the really decent display that comes with aniti glare feature  ##  definitely better than my asus vivobook whose display suck . Performance wise too it's good you can play games like valorant and gta 5 in lower settings without any significant frame drops . It can also handle Adobe photoshop smoothly . However there are two things that I didn't like with this laptop.. ####   Never Buy HP products because their technical team has 0 knowledge about their products and they always give stupid reasons .......... Also they transfer call to one another saying they will solve but you will never get solution... not only this they will say you about call back which you will never get and at last they themself say why did you buy the hp product... ####   I purchased this laptop on 24th August. And today ##  it is not even switching on. This was not at all expected either from HP or from Amazon. Very very disappointed. ####   Not valuable for this price try another one... ####   Lightweight and super fast ####   Great laptop ####   GOOD ####   Used product delivered. ####   Quality is very poor nowadays.not expected from hp ####   It’s worth to buy.I appreciate my decision to buy this product..no screen touch.No finger reader ####   My  product back is damaged  ##  I  felt  that  I  was received replacement product  ##  I  wanna replace it ####   After purchasing of 15 days windows corrupted. ####   Performance is great . ####   I liked the laptop. Very light weight and convenient to use. Can go for it if you are looking for an everyday use laptop. Battery performance could be a bit better but in all I like it. ####   I received and checked the product almost everything is fine but when I create login credentials it clearly says windows activated in July 2021 and antivirus and other products also about to expire in three days. Iam totally surprised with this.  AMAZON ARE U SELLING ME A USED PRODUCT. Quite worried though didn’t find any other issues ####   It's so attractive for presentation. ####    1.The cooling fan not working ####   i bought this recently.very slim and sleek .nice product ####   Totally useless product and shame on you @Amazon ####   Do not buy ##  received laptop today afternoon and stopped working in the evening. Not getting any help from Amazon. ####   Likes: ####   The product was ok for 1 week next microphone and speaker is not working ####   Excellent product at this price ##  just a bit disappointed with the build quality ##  rest all is excellent. ####   Nice one! ####   Did not liked ####   I got used one month warranty ####   Am using this lap for last 2 month. I am really satisfied with this lap. ####   Like ####   F11 key popes out the first time I used it. HP service asking 7k to replcae the entire top panel plus keyboard as they claim this isn't covered in warranty. Really disappointed ##  go for a apple instead at least the quality is top notch ####   I bought this on 4th of july ##  installed android studio and started running the program through emulator ##  laptop started stuck. It has 8gm ram i did not expect this behaviour. ####   it was delivered on 05 Jul and today screen is totally blank. please help whom to approach as return window was closed after one week that was on 11 Jul. its screen is totally blank. not expected from HP ####   Performance wise I preferred this laptop ####   It's display have permanent keyboard impressions . Really disappointing 😞 !. ####   Good product ####   The laptop is fast and light weight. should hv come with a bag too (as compliment) ####   This computer is very fast ##  light weight and running everything smooth. ####   Perfect ####   Some of hit otherwise best for use great body fast bussness and student both useable  use 7 day good product ####   Pls don't buy Laptop or costly things from Amazon. They give used products and then don't replace it ####   I have been using this laptop for 3 weeks and working as expected  so far. But the inbuilt antivirus was expired and I did not get benefit of inbuilt antivirus ####   Worst product...may be a repaired..keyboard not working properly and Amazon took 1 month for refund after several stress making followups...from my experience ####   Laptop was Good and Battery backup excellent. ####   Light weight and easy to carry ####   - ####   The warranty of the laptop has started two months earlier from the purchase date ##  to update this hp needs a proper bill will serial number which Amazon denied to provide ##  this is the only issue ####   Heats up too fast. Fragile plastic. Office 2019 not installed. Hp customer care takes time to respond. Not value for money. ####   My laptop is not getting charged it is still on 0% after charging for 3 4 hrs and after i m taking out from charging it is getting switched off ####   I got this laptop just today and the processor speed in the laptop mentions as 2.4Ghz and in the product description as 4.3GHz. Mc-caffe antivirus had also expired as soon as the laptop got booted. Looks like a renewed one. Dont go for it. ####   One month of experience ##  nothing bad about the product. But 59000/- (amount that I spent) is too much for it. There are better laptops for same process range. Felt somewhat regret after buying it. ####   Good product ####   Fast ##  lightweight ## small ##  compact ####   Touch pad stopped working within a month ####   The battery backup  will remain 4 to 5 hrs and some heating issue there. I bought for 59k and if it may contain fingerprint sensor and anti glare screen would be the best. Performance is good and very light to carry. This lap is best for programmers and students. ####   heating a lot only the issue ####   Other than the heating issue ##  which is also not that great a problem ##  I do not see any problem with this laptop. It gets all the work done and quickly ##  has free Microsoft office Home and Student ##  FHD screen ##  and it's super light and handy. ####   Value for Money ####   It boots up really fast. 7 seconds to be exact! ####   Don't go for this product. I had purchased this laptop on 8th June but on 17 th June its Motherboard  got faulty.select lenovo ## Dell or Asus have better option with smoothly  working products. ####   Light weight ##  smart look ####   Bought for my daughter. Works perfectly. Antivirus subscription should have been for an year at least. ####   Excellent laptop ##  light weight ####   Got this laptop delivered fast and was quite excited about the it but ##  unfortunately it started showing error from day 2. When I submitted for a replacement sellers wanted me to wait for inspection. Now just holding the unused box with me. They have not done the basic quality check before dispatch. Also the laptop was configured months ago even before purchase so I am losing warranty period. Quite disappointed with this purchase ####   Very good by speed ##  light weight and sleek ####   Worst experience total waste of products worst customer experience........no responsibility ####   Heating issue also I faced....and it cools down very fast if we shut down the system. While keeping it on charging and if we use  ##  then also it's get heat up...light weight ####   Within 20 days of usage ##  the laptop started having problems with the battery ##  taking 8 to 10 hours for charging and the machine getting overheated. Calls and complaints to Customer Care yielding no response. Disgusting.👎 ####   Speaker  max volume is less and battery backup is very poor  ## system boot is fast. If the brightness of screen is increased the laptop in just 30 mins to low power ####   Value for money ####   The battery back up is very poor. I could do online classes only for 3 hours only. The battery goes down within 2.5 hours. Know idea about games. It's light weighed. I would suggest not to buy online as the local shops give you gifts like keyboard ##  mouse ##  pendrive and keyboard covers. ####   Laptop is not upto the mark as expected ##  heating problem and charging is getting over easily ##  camera is not good..don't buy. ####   very thine and light laptop ##  ####   Recommended for buying.  Please check price and compare the specs to check whether it is worth or not. Best buy.. ####   I was already requested for return. ####   1st point don't by on exchange any product coz ##  while collecting they come up with new rule and 2nd don't buy HP laptop they service sucks ####   Good product. Only drawback I learnt is it can't be extended for Warranty which is disappointing."},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 14-inch (35.5 cms) Thin & Light FHD Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Windows 10/MS Office/Natural Silver/1.41 kg) ##  14-dv0543TU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹71 ## 385.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹11 ## 395.00 (16%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Processor: 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 (up to 4.2 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Technology ##  8 MB L3 cache ##  4 cores) # Memory & Storage: 8 GB DDR4-3200 MHz RAM (2 x 4 GB) ##  upgradable upto 16 GB| Storage: 512 GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD # Display: 35.6 cm (14\") diagonal ##  FHD (1920 x 1080) ##  IPS ##  micro-edge ##  anti-glare ##  250 nits ##  45% NTSC # Graphics & Networking: Intel Iris Xᵉ Graphics | Realtek RTL8822CE 802.11a/b/g/ac (2x2) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5 combo # Operating System & Preinstalled Software: Pre-loaded Windows 10 Home with lifetime validity ##  FREE Upgrade to Windows 11* (when available ##  refer product description for more details) | Microsoft Office Home & Student 2019##", "no_of_rating": "1 ## 065 ratings", "avg_rating": "4.4", "total_no_answer": "\n357 answered questions\n", "delivery_type": "Details", "delivery_date": "FREE Delivery.", "Model": "HP Pavilion Laptop 14-dv0543TU", "Brand": "HP", "SpecificUses": "Multimedia", "ScreenSize": "14 Inches", "OS": "Windows 10 Home", "more_detail": "\nBrand\n#\n‎HP\n\n\nManufacturer\n#\n‎hp, HP India Sales Pvt.

So I think you guys have a clear image of how excited I was when I got the Pavilion with 16gb DDR4 RAM ##  i5 11th gen and intel iris XE. Let me give you a clear image of my purpose of this laptop. I am buying this laptop solely for the purpose of college ##  so for downloading all the softwares required in the mechanical engineering field ##  softwares required for assignments(power point ##  office ##  word) ##  softwares for communicating(whatsapp ##  telegram ##  mail) and entertainment platforms(netflix ##  prime ##  spotify) and other programs as potplayer ##  qbit and a bit of tweaking. The battery life on this ultrabook is really good( I can't really say the best even though I want to because I haven't really had the opportunity to explore the battery life of this laptop's direct competitors). It easily lasts upto 4.5-5 hours when I set the battery option to best performance). Its built quality dazzled me as it was really sturdy than it appeared. No loose hinges or anything. The screen stays where we set it ##  and no wobble while typing which shows the rubber grips are placed parallel to the surface. The display is bit less brighter than I anticipated ##  I would give it a 9/10. The typing experience is really good on this keyboard ##  however the color for the keyboard was a bit of a bad choice. I am a OCD type of person ##  So I get a bit irritated when I find smudges on the trackpad ##  keyboard ##  or on the inner surface of the laptop ##  but I doubt you guys will even notice it. The sound quality is really good on the laptop. This weighs around 1.4 kg so this laptop is easily portable ##  without compromising on performance ##  battery life and display (atleast for me). ####   Light weight and good design. Performance also sounds good. Only minus is there is no Ethernet  and VGA port ####   I HAD PURCHASED ON 14.06.21 But from 30.08.21 it is creating problem ##  Automatically got shut down and restarted after 5 minutes and again restarted. Why I dont know ##  and I have no warranty card also. ####   Worst Amazon experience ever. This laptop arrived with a defective battery and even after 3 hours of charging ##  the battery level remained at 65% when the power cord was removed from supply. Immediately on removing the power cord the laptop shuts down. There is no matter any charge left on the laptop battery which seems to be defective. Never expected such a faulty product from HP. Very pathetic and really disappointed. Could not return it or replace it without booking an inspection appointment. Waiting for them to arrive and inspect it. Never buy HP products as they dont appear to be QC ed properly. Could not give a negative rating so selecting 1 star. ####   Have a good in size ####   Worst build quality ####   Best in category. Light weight. Battery life is very good. ####   sometime in my meetings the laptop suddenly shuts down without even telling this is rare it has happend to me 3-4 times but overall very nice laptop and very light ####   Best laptop for students ## thank you appario seller ##  product is very good ##  and delivered before 1 day of estimated delivery date. ####   HP would not consider dead pixel in warranty as they need 2 dead pixels. Above that if in case there is a dead pixel ##  then they will try their best to put up many reasons to not entertain it in warranty ##  calling it customer induced damage.. LOL.. ####   Good laptop . ####   I was purchased on 9th July and system was dead on 23rd Aug'2021 during important work. ####   Overall good laptop ##  with good specs ##  ## there aren't somany issues with the laptop ##  ##  good display ##  sound quality is good ##  fast enough for any work ##  light weight ##  low fan noise ##  good viewing angles ##  best booting up and shutting down time ##  charges fastly  ## etc... ####   A bad choice purchase from amazon. After a week of use ##  the laptop screen display goes off every 5 to 10 minutes. When it goes off ##  I need to switch the laptop on ##  the display comes back and after 5 minutes again goes off ##  again switch it on.  Tired of it. Frustrated. Don't buy electronics from Amazon. ####   Battery life is 7 to 8 hrs. Although if you use heavy apps like chrome ##  the battery life drains in 6 to 5 hrs. But if you game it drains in 4 hrs. ####    I had seen the specifications and bought this laptop upon checking details this laptop is not 4.2ghz it is only 2.42 ghz. The battery does not last more than 2 hours ####   Incredible performance and refined design make this a winner. A brilliant screen and classic design meets a high price. Till now working satisfactorily. ####    I wasted my money and compain many time but they did not respond. ####   Overall performance is very good. Battery lasts for 4-5 hours. ####   Performance is great with lightening speed  ##  battery is okok and little heating issues ####   Display is not good. ####   A nice product works efficiently and fast enough.Only problem is that it heats a lot during usage. ####   The sound & camera quality is poor. Overall the laptop is performant. ####   It is a good laptop in this price as compared to other brands. Fast booting. Applications open in a blink of eye. Only thing which HP has in its legacy is heating. It gets heated even with normal working. Screen ##  speakers everything is better when compared with the same price range laptops of other brands. Charging speed is okay ##  cannot say fast. Battery holds up for 5-6 hours for normal office work. All in all a good buy. ####   Loved the size and lightweight of laptop. It surely gives premium feel. 512 SSD and 16 gb ram..boosts multitasking..did not face any issue yet. Only thing is don't buy this laptop for gaming as the keyboard keys looks delicate. ####   Better configuration and great performance ####   Laptop stopped working and does not power on in just 2weeks of purchase. HP support doesn't replace the system instead will send service engineer to fix it. Never expected such poor service ##  made a mistake of purchasing the laptop. I want the laptop to be either replaced or would like to return it for refund please. ####   Broken seals … so I am not sure that original product is inside … so returned.. very bad ..I came to a decision that better to buy offline… ####   Sleek ##  slim and works great ####   decent product lightweight  8/10 ####   Nice product in this price range ####   Very happy with the laptop. It's sleek ##  fast with 16gb RAM. ####   Nice ####    The laptop I received was having RAM issues which could only be diagnosed after 7 days. And so I have to incur the repair cost .Hence I would advise not to buy anything electronic from Amazon. ####   Update after one month usage - MS Office 2019 preinstalled edition became unlicensed version within 30 days and refused to activate. HP support shared their product sheet that stated that this laptop came only with a trial version of MS Office 2019. Now I am chasing seller Appario Retail to honour the commitment. ####   In my opinion it’s worth purchase below 60K ..experience after 15 days is very good.. sound quality and battery support  exceptional ####   Have been using this laptop since 4 month. Performance is great. It boots in second. Fingerprint reader works superfast. ####   Good laptop. ####   Laptop is good but Battery  gives 2 to 3 hours backup. HP has to upgrade their batteries..  At least 4 hour's back required.. ####   This product is very good for home use - for children's education and for home entertainment like watching movies and also for other normal computing purposes like web browsing ##  document management etc. ####   Do not purchase any HP ##  unless you are very sure of. The touch pad makes noise while scrolling or using. ####   Battery life is around 6 hrs ####   these laptop are good for nothing a pathetic sound and absolute poor battery life. ####   All good ##  except volume!! ####   Air vent is towards down side....can't keep the laptop in lap as it easily becomes hot....very good specs for this price but compramised for the build ####   Light weight.Afraid it is not sturdy as plastic body..but runs like a horse. No lag..no snags.. runs smoothly ####   Product is good however  giving 1 star  because of \"Amazon only\" who  is highlighting under partner offer ####   After 4 months of use I found ##  Sometimes MOUSE touch pad does not work properly.  Otherwise everything  is okay. ####   Poor battery life . Maximum 2hrs with the battery saver on . DON'T BUY!! ####   Some keys are not functioning correctly...when you press @ ##  it prints \". Lot of problems in writing email addresses ####   This laptop is way ahead of its time! ####   That is a amazing product from Amazon ####   Amazon delivery was fast ##  but this tym packaging was not good ##  it should be rapped with bubble rapper. ####   Well built laptop.  Very fast working. Good experience til now.  Satisfied with purchase ####   Really a light and thin laptop. ####   Wonderfull product ##  very light weight ##  easy to handle and gives u a steady and metallic feel ####   Have been using for a week. Easy to install. Satisfied. ####   Battery life is very good ##  touch pad is very responsive ##  keyboard has 2 settings for backlit lighting. Ports are a little tough in the beginning. Great buy 👌"},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP 15 11th Gen Intel Core i3 Processor 15.6\" (39.62cms) FHD Laptop with Alexa Built-in(i3-1115G4/8GB/1TB HDD/M.2 Slot/Win 10/MS Office/Natural Silver/1.76 Kg) ##  15s-du3038TU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹46 ## 805.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹5 ## 815.00 (12%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available* Disclaimer-*The Windows 11 upgrade will be delivered late 2021 into 2022.

Iam also from IT Industry and know the Norms ####   Very very slow..

Shadow of Tomb Raider ##  Arkham Knights) with Low Settings like Resolution around 720p and all advanced settings disbaled(Vsync ##  TAA etc.). ####   Not quality ##  display and sound is good. ####   First order hang alot then replcmnt come not turning on fake product dont buy please ####   Horrible service ##  delayed till the return validity expired. ####   I am using almost from months time. For my KG going kid schooling purpose. God knows how HP build and approve the product. Every time getting hang. I have updated all the software from authentic source. ####   Waste of money ##  8GM RAM performing like 1 GB RAM ...very slow response all the time. Not even suggested for kids purpose to watch movies.... really disappointed. No value for money if you buy this device. ####   The much awaited laptop had to be returned as the Silver colour laptop has the key board also silver colour with letters in thin golden colour print. Being a senior citizen with reasonably good vision ##  I just couldn't use the key boards as the alphabets ##  numbers & symbols are just not readable in natural light as well as room light. They could be seen with difficulty only when the key board is tilted. But ##  in the tilted position ##  the laptop cannot be used. Disappointed. My other laptop ##  Apple Mac which is also silver colour ##  has the key board in black with all letters in white and with back light facility to operate even in complete darkness. ####   The Battery doesn't even last for 2 hours on single charge. We have returned the Item and bought a DELL Version ##  works very well ####   Delivery: laptop is damaged on the corner. Very bad delivery. ####   Please return this package as soon as possible there is lots of issue with the laptop. ####   Best for study and All ####   Good choice to by HP laptop ##   value for money.. ####   Firstly I was afraid to buy it online due to negative reviews but I ordered it. I got the original product by appario. I have not any problems till now. Go for it. ####   The Laptop is ok...but at the time of starting taking to start 10 to 15 minute.. ####   At the start of computer purchasing desktop was very fast ##  but as days go by about 3 or 4 days it is taking more time and also google chrome wasn\"t working well and on a short timer intervals it goes black and comes back again ##  in my view home premium is totally worthless and waste. ####   Hangs a lot ##  purchased 2 days ago... ####   Comes with office home and student edition. Good for school and college going students ####   Product is good ##  But having a problem in MIC ####   Excellent laptop for people who are looking for basic features and application ##  study purpose etc. ####   Processing not fast ####   Not suggest anybody to buy this ####   Very slow  and very bad ####   Lap top15 11th gen Intel core I3 ####   Don’t buy very slow …. Not work properly ####   Anti glare ####   The major problem with this model is ##  it is very very slow.. Expected a bit faster operations as per laptop specifications..even if you are doing very basic operations even if you are simply browsing few websites..rest things are as expected..battery backup is good ####   Poor quality and refurbished product delivered ####   i was scared of buying laptop after seeing many negative reviews ##  but my necessity made it buy.  I was very satisfied with the performance ##  look ##  usage ##  style ##  sleek ##  etc.  no heating issues.  simply order laptop and start doing work.  MS Office is available.  HP support is great.  Don't go for negative reviews.  Choose laptop according to u r need.  If you want to play games go for gaming laptop or keep more money to buy more processors.  I want for general purpose and it is more than enough. ####   Very slow... ####   Takes time to boot ####   Worst product. Purchsed on Feb 4. Trying to install oracle software to work. Hangs so badly for hours. Booting time is so bad it literally takes 5 to 6 minutes to open up. Worst experience ever. Once I restart the laptop all the data will be erased. I doubt was it really a new lap or refurbished one. Really disappointed. ####   Vry slow ####   Slow and sound like bees. ####   pathetic laptop laging hanging very slow speed waste of money ####   Phone is quite fast although it has HSD drive value for money ####   This Laptop fulfilled our requirements as per its configuration. ####   Good ####   Good ####   Light weight- Good finishing and easy to use. ####   Laptop has a good look works moderate ####   for day to day use it is good one. my use is not so extensive so I m happy with this ####   Only dislike: ####   Please don't buy this product ##  ####   Overall performance and silver design(15s-du3038tu) are really good. I buy it for 39k on festival sale. ####   As per product description the laptop had 3 cell battery but it does not give more than 1 hour backup even when you are not watching videos or listening music. In terms of battery backup it is worst than acer asus performance ####   Processing are very slow ####   Performance is good but for gaming not appropriate ####   AWESOME PRODUCT JUST COMPANY SHOULD PROVIDE DETAIL INFO ABOUT PRODUCT. ####   I purchased the order on Jan 28th and got the delivery of the laptop on Jan 30. I bought an 8 GB RAM version ##  when I started using the laptop ##  it was hanging ##  lagging ##  and running slowed than my 10-year-old laptop. I spoke with HP and they told me that my laptop was registered for the warranty on Dec 2020. I was shocked. There were multiple files in TEMP folder from May ##  Sep ##  Oct and Dec 2020. ####   I was delighted to see affordable laptop with Intel i3 11th generation with good specs. From the time I opened the machine I felt let down by HP. ####   Serial number of laptop is not written on invoice ##  and warranty card of that serial number is also not given with item. ####    The monitor of the said laptop is blinking continuously ##  I don't want to return it.

Did not expect this from HP. Please update your specs to provide this information to your customers ####   Kindly do not doubt the durability of this product  ## this is a full action packed beast that is multitasking and satisfy all your need at once .The screen wobble issue is not a major concern as the screen does not wobble even when you are working on it  and it may wobble a little bit of you forcefully try to push or pull the screen.Do not consider the negative comments  ## buy it right away ####    I didn't face any heating issue ##  i don't play games but the temperature never goes over 55°C. ####   Pros: Do use cooling pad! For better gaming experience or least buy laptop stand for air intake ##  thermals are extremely good. I'll just say that you understand better ##  I played war zone while streaming ##  max temp 79°C ####   Best quality display ####    Don't purchase this laptop  ##  quality of screen fame is too poor .Touch pad is too big we are not able type text quickly and another dis advantage is power button is mixed on keyboard .Body quality is too poor ####   It's a great laptop with good specs but only issue I found was wobbling of screen so watch some videos about it's review on screen. ####   For gamers- ####   Victus ❤️ ####   Screen wobbles like anything if you switch on the fan . Hp shud note that not everyone in india use centralaised ac without ceiling fan . i think the loosened the screen hinge so that u can open/ lift the screen without applying pressure or holding the keybord  ##  and they have ended up creating a very loose screen which wobbles like anything . has anyone found a solution to this ####   It's too expensive considering its built quality and wobbling ##  ####   Pros- ####   Screen flicker every time.. ####   Ente mone eth kollam..paranjuvarumpo ellam parayanollo..battery kollam 70 watta ahhh.7hours kittum makkalle..pinne...game kalichamm...work chyyan..

OS upgradation is not clear in terms of further cost ##  etc. ####   Price increase Karne se koi purchase karega.log less karte he iha to bar Raha he.no cost EMI bhi nhi he ####   High Quality product  ## When you watching movies etc its really great feeling because of screen and grafix quality . I'm use for coding and it's. Really great. ####   Let me clear the confusion here ## this is my point of view ## I'm using it from one week. ####   1. Screen not that bad as explained by many unless you deliberately want to mess with it. ####   Mind blowing specifications ##  and nice package delivered. ####   in amazon prime day  ##  my hdfc 500 Rs. cashback nat come ####   Build quality is not good. ####   The screen wobble is not noticeable while typing/using the laptop. I could only notice it if I intentionally flick the screen. ####   Very nice package  ##  AMD Ryzen5 5thseries. Enogh for CAD ##  Graphic designs and games  ##  SSD helps in Instant start. ####   Looking good ##  I like it ####   - Built like a tank ####   It's a good gamming laptop (normal gamming) things i love in this laptop is its battery life ## thermals ## ms office life time validity and it comes with a decent looks. if you're student and search for good gamming and normal use it is the best but if you want only a gamming laptop then go to hp pavilion 15-ec2004AX model in flipkart it comes with same specifications and includes refresh rate of 144hz in 64k price ####   I am not a gamer. I purchased this laptop to do the Coding activities. I do the Frondend development using reactJs  ## Node and Docker and it seems everything is pretty fast and has no lag at all.The Browsers and VS Code open very fast and overall very good performance. ####    Pro's : ####   Wobbling effect is very prominent and no doubt in that. Just switch on your fan and you can see it clearly. If still you can't notice it ##  then start your webcam and see the earthquake on your screen. Apart from this everything else is very nice. Amazon offer 14% off ##  Exchanged my 10 years old asus laptop for 12k ##  coupon discount 2k ##  some more discount with credit card.... Got it @Rs. 51 ## 740. Thanks to Amazon for excellent service and offer. Delivery received on 10.08.2021. Finally ##  you may ignore the wobble effect for this configuration at this budget. Even though the screen will be having wobble effect but it's not affecting while doing any work on laptop. Opening the lid a bit extra reduces the wobble effect to a great extent. If getting the lappy on a good offer price ##  then go for it. ####   It's just fast at an affordable price. ####   Laptop looks ok. ####   Best Laptop for Daily use ##  and gaming bettry life is best Around 6 to 7 hours. ####   As far as i used i think this laptop is fine ##  ####   Build quality is good.its not what everyday dad said but screen does wobble. Overall it's a nice package ####   It's great for gaming as well as for daily activities ##  the screen wobbles a bit if touched and is slightly heavy but I think as per the price it's great and does all tasks very smoothly."},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP 15 11th Gen Intel Core i5 Processor 15.6-inch (39.6 cm) FHD Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD +32GB Intel Optane/Win 10/MS Office/Jet Black/1.69 Kg) ##  15s-fq2071TU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹59 ## 452.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹4 ## 462.00 (8%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available* Disclaimer-*The Windows 11 upgrade will be delivered late 2021 into 2022.

Recommended for folks looking for a sleek laptop focused on good performance for light use at home ####    Nice product+very slim & light weight. ####   Enriched with all latest features. ####   This is one amazing product ##  viewers if you are planning on purchasing this one ##  do it and you won't regret it ❤ ####   Firstly it is a very light weight laptop … It has backlit keyboard   ##  it is very fast as it is SSD and the color is dark grey . It looks beautiful . Downloading of apps is easy and very fast . There is finger print reader as well which gives more privacy & security . ####   Its good ####   It was so fast that I had called technician stating that my laptop is not shutting down completely. ####   Neat design ##  fast performance  ##  superfast fingerprint reader and backlit keyboard ##  superfast charging. ####   You are getting more rather than what are you paying. ####   Laptop is good in this price range.

No defects found. ####   Light weight and slim with rich look ##  ####   Network keep on disconnecting whereas on other device its 100% stable without any disconnections. ####   An excellent machine for the price for business usecases like MS Office and web browsing. Intel CPU does work well and at cooler temperatures than the Ryzen 3 processors that come at a similar price. Go for it if you're not looking for very CPU and GPU intensive workflows like hardcore gaming and video editing as it has only integrated GPU. The system is extremely lightweight and blazing fast due to the ample 8gb RAM and 512 gb SSD. This is a 1 week usage review.

It's working well without any problems. The only problem I have faced is ##  when my mobile vibrates ##  the laptop ##  when beside the mobile ##  rattles sometimes.

When i try to activate the MS office 2019 product key which is not activated because it is already used and the product warranty shows only 10 month remaining.

Amazon support executive was also unreachable. ####   I Like it 👍🏼 ####   The colour silver grey and sleek design gives premium look. ####   Nice 🙂🙂 ####   Worst laptop ####   Perfect for Mid level Work load. ####   I buyied it on prime day sale and bought it at 35k after all discount and cashback. ####   Worst product ####   Overall good product for personal use ####   Defective product not starting ####   Value for money ####   Having worked with Acer ##  Dell and HP ##  wanted to try Lenovo and was disappointed as the machine was painfully slow from bootup to shutdown. ####   Service given for installation .. I dont even know if it's in good condition . ####   Not satisfied ##  touch pad is vibrating and touchpad keys are worst..  performance speed is slow ##  built quality is very bad and the product is more than 1.7 kg ##  totally not satisfied ##   I am looking for return and refund by Amazon.. ####   In just 3months laptop skin is damaged ####   It's like Soo good. It's also very light weight and stylish. I really recommend this thing ####   Laptop not fast working battery timing only 1 hours plz don't purchase anybody ####   I have been using this laptop from around three months and I am quite satisfied with the product. ####   Good for personal use. But battery backup is not upto mark. ####   About weight it's ok but not the light weight regarding battery it is not giving max 4 hours... It is draining fastly. ####   Nice product for normal uses like online classes ##  simple office work. ####   This laptop is amazing. I really love it. This is the first big purchase i made from my salary savings ##  so i did a lot of research. After a month of using ##  i can say: the battery is really good. The sound system is also really good. Love the display and the design. The camera is shit and it's really pixelated but i don't mind. The big empty space at the bottom of the screen really bothered me before buying but i barely even notice it. It even gives an elevated feel to the screen and i quite like it. So yea ##  I'm happy with my decision to buy this. ####   Camera quality should be good ####   Like ####   Overall performance good ####   Average battery life and poor camera. ####   Average ####   Nice ####   Can go for it ####   Worst product.. they will give you a defective piece and the replacement will never happen. ####   The battery life is so poor. Always needs to be plugged in for charging. And it's obviously slow due to less RAM capacity. ####   The screen does not turn on ##  a few days after purchase. Now have to run after getting it repaired. :/ ####   Best in market at this price. Battery around  5 hour in continue use. Full hd screen. Camera good. Smooth keypad. Start quickly. No keypad light. ####   Most most most pathetic laptop on planet earth. Sloth would run faster than this laptop. 1 is the lowest rating i could give it deserves 0. I am requesting you guys with joininh hands pls don't go for this laptop eva. Go for hp anytime. Slowest laptop on planet. ####   Worst battery backup ####   This is so good... Really best... Hard disk capacity is little low however u can use a external 1TB Harddrive ####   Not happy with memory configuration for ~34K ####   Pros: ####   I liked the metal body. It didnt heat up like my 8th gen laptop. Performance has been good for multitasking so far. I didnt like the webcam resolution. ####   Just bought this product really excellent product. Fast ##  Hight battery life and graphics is awesome. Highly recommended product. Happy Me. ####   Very poor plastic used in laptop bottom side. ####   Light weight. MS office is part of the package. However ##  only Word and Excel are installed. PowerPoint is missing. ####   1. Worst laptop ##  search button is not working. ####   Poor Display. Not worthy! ####   Received a defective product. Integrated camera not detected. Tech support from Lenovo wasn't helping on time. Amazon replacement policy is also painful... ####   decent laptop for the price.. bought for around 32k from amazon. very light weight and sturdy. battery lasts very much and charges very quickly. ####   I am totally satisfied with it."},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcer Aspire 5 AMD Ryzen 5 5500U Processor 15.6 inches Business Laptop - (8 GB/512 GB SSD/Windows 10 Home/Radeon Graphics /Microsoft Office 2019/1.76 kg/Silver) A515-45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹64 ## 990.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹6 ## 550.00 (10%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": "₹58 ## 440.00", "about": "#This laptop packs a punch in terms of performance as it comes with an AMD Ryzen 5500U processor .

Bad product ####   I am sharing this review after purchasing laptop from local shop where I get best deal.. here are some genuine reason why you with pros and cons.. ##  ####   Good Battery life ##  snappy performance (any time I had minimum 15 chrome tabs open along with 3-4 other apps. No lag. ####   Everything is awesome good for students and little gaming and it has and issue i face when i was updated the update  ## The battery percentage from 100% it went to 25% in half an hour and the speakers are shit better get a pair of earphone ####   I love all over design of laptop thin and lightweight and performance of this laptop is unbelievable its full fill my all requirements but price range higher because when we see on acer official website price are low and always show out of stock over all acer doing very well in term of body we got aluminum top and backlit keyboard ####   We had purchased for our son and he just loved using the laptop for everyday use ##  Coding ##  watching videos ##  attending webinars and attending his classes online. The battery backup is amazing and the Laptop overall is just awesome. No issues as of now connecting to Wifi 2.5 ghz/ 5 ghz band. Since we have Airtel broadband the Wifi autoconnects to highest 5 ghz band and is super fast. Laptop opens up super fast and depends on if we have configured any login password or personalised photos/background during Laptop login page ##  based on which little difference may be seen but overall great processor for faster access to anything to be done with this laptop. Not has an opportunity to contact ACER for any issue as Laptop is working great. Thank You. ####   Very sleek...light weight...very fast... ####   Used it for a week and.... ####   Product as mentioned ####   I was eyeing for this laptop since its announcement. ####   Speaker and camera ####   I found this Laptop on ACER and Croma site at night for 53K and 52K. Being sleepy ##  I left it and next morning it was out of stock on both. Then I bought it on Amazon for 56K less 1K discount for HDFC card. ####   Everything's great in this machine. ####   Amazing display ##  good battery backup ####   The 5500U is ##  to slightly put it ##  ABSOLUTELY BONKERS ##  Gives even the Current Generation i7s ##  (dare I say i9s) a run for their money. Compiles the entire Linux kernel in under a minute (If you don't know what that means ##  let me tell you its Performance is Beyond Comprehension) ####   Excellent battery life ##  decent screen with IPS so good viewing angles ##  Lightweight aluminium top body ##  boots up and shuts down in seconds because of 8GB RAM and 512 GB SSD. AMD Radeon Graphics does the job well ##  can play light games. Soft and brisk touchpad. Overall a good package in the price. ####   Good ####   It's a complete waste of money product. Sound Volume and Quality is worst. Build quality is very basic. ####   Good laptop ##  6 core 12 thread's cpu with 8gb soldered ram ##  can be expanded upto 24gb  ##  slot for 2.5 inch hard disk / sata 2.5 inch ssd is given which can be installed upto 2tb ##  mounts are provided for that ##  1080p ips screen and backlit full side keyboard provided though backlit keyboard brightness can't be controlled ##  available for a lesser price ##  check acer online store or offline store. ####   just you look this laptop every things has been provide most important is that acer service centre. Today I have visited with my laptop to install external HDD. what a service just took 5 minutes. Manager Jogesh has tolled me due pandemic I am ready to send my technical staff in my resident. What more you want. Another best quality service of Amazon they have give me this ACER ASPIRE AMD RYZEN 5-5500U laptop within 04 days. Amazon hats off You. Its looks too Good and best keyboard minor sound supposed to be high. Otherwise every parts & function are too excellent. ACER Wishing you all the best . I was purchased first  laptop on  2007 it was Acer next two are HP now again I purchased ACER. ####   Good value for money.

A handfull of laptop. Simply the best laptop computer I have used so far. Battery does not last as advertised. But I get a decent 10 plus hours backup. In the last one week ##  I charged it only twice. Screen is a very big plus. Very clear and nice display. I reduce the resolution to use my engineering drawings and bring it back to recommended setting after my work is done. We need to wait for all apps to catchup with this resolution. Keyboard and touchpad are fluid. Fingerprint is a breeze. Some bloatware found. I uninstalled some and kept some that that I felt is of use. Speakers are quite good. I read reviews and saw videos and was waiting for a disastrous sound. But the sound is quite good. Most importantly ##  we can hear a full surround sound from these two speakers. The spacing is such that it feels like listening through headphones due to the size of the laptop. ####   Bought the laptop after lot of research.. my main criterias while searching for a laptop were large high resolution display (to view medical images) ##  portability and fast processing.. This one has won in all three.. Very satisfied with this purchase.. Thanks LG and Amazon.. ####   Superb ##  light weight with17\" screen ##  almost full day battery back up ##  very good kwality product from LG ##  love this it ####   top rated screen ####   Simply Value For Money Laptop ####   its been a week ##  the laptop works fine ##  as mentioned is super light ##  even compared to 14/13\" laptop ##  but thats why it is flimsy ##  you will have to be careful plugging charging cable or usb into its ports. ####   Can be better if it has 16 GB RAM. It is very fast and good to work. ####   Very good battery ##  Big screen ##  light weight ##  screen is high resolution but very straining to eyes ##  UV filtration is very bad compared to other laptops ####   Buy Apple MacBook instead. Don't go for LG. It is pathetic in quality and service. Go for MACBOOK AIR M1 ####   Superfast ##  Very slim and lightweighted for this screensize. ####   Earlier I was thinking of getting the 11th gen version but its coming with LPDDR5 so the RAM won't be upgradable. ####   Very competent package. ####   1 lakh me without dedicated GPU... My opinion don't buy... Buy any apply macbook on this price range thank you... ####   I have been looking for this laptop for a few months but have not bought it previously as I already have an HP high configuration Laptop but finally decided to buy it. ####   Really light ##  superb display. ####   The product is good for it's price in India. Obviously it is almost 30k higher than what it is in the US but that's what most fo the laptop companies do in India. The tax diffrences are not that big to create such a price difference but unfortunately most of the companies use this tactics in India. ####   I didnt know that LG also makes laptop.

Really fed-up like anything. Guys please listen my words.. I'm not a fake account. I'm a verified buyer. Don't buy this Wastage! I have received a defect product it was not even booted up eventhough I have charged 5 to 6 hrs. Display was blinked that's it. Guys don't waste your time & money and also there is no Service center in India. Even Call support also no response. If you mailed them only you will get an auto generated mail reply. 2 times I have mailed then one person called & simply she said no service center sir!!!! Guys again I'm telling don't waste your time & money. Then requested for return the next day courier partner picked up the courier & the amount rs 19 ## 990 has returned to my bank account. Amazon very fast delivery & Very fast return policies also. But Amazon please don't support this kind of rubbish product. ####   Yeh leptop 1 month me kharab bhi ..ho gaya abhi maine iski emi bhi nhi diya hai... ####   Paddai ke liye ####   Disaster. ####   Don't buy ##  worst product ####   After one month of using ##  it stops booting. Service department does not reply after continuous call for last three days. I doubt whether there is any service activity or not. ####   2 days of usage at the time of writing this review. ####   It has been slightly over a month and the laptop has been problematic.The windows keep on booting with no help from customer service so far.Called up the RDP support  multiple times but they disconnected the call ####   Worst support ##  within 10 days it's stop working. No on to support on support or phone. Don't buy this product ####    Its a brand new laptop but with in a month its restart again n again. If u r trying to go to the bios settings not possible in this condition. I think many users face this same issue with RDP. After 10 days return replacement policy expire this issue happend. ####   It is not starting after receiving and return pickup is not yet done. ####   This laptop is not starting . It is not becoming on & shutdown. Please refund my money & return this laptop. ####   Quality ####   Yeh product thekh kam nhi krta hain . Maine ise do din use kiya .

I am a verified buyer of thinbook from RDP the first version .. there was an issue with the laptop .. it was not turning on .. I thought it could be the battery and checked with a local who verified it for me .. something to do with the disk .. I called up customer service told them my model number (this is important to note) and explained the issue .. they asked me to ship it to Andra .. Ananthapur .. I used professional courier who said 600 rupees for extra care .. I did not mind paying .. once it reached them .. they have the audacity to call me and say .. you model number is out of production and we don't get spares .. THIS IS A SCAM COMPANY .. I hate writing reviews like this .. but please do not buy .. rather buy a second hand albeit 5k or 10k extra .. atleast.they don't cheat .. I am robbed of 10k from this computer company .. ####   I have purchased RDP thinbook on 22/07/2021..after 2 months ##  its harddisk gone out of order... The product of RDP are not at all providing valur for money ##  Not only that ##  against the 1year onsite warranty ##  i have been calling them  to get it repaired/replaced.. No reply from the RDP work station... Poor quality products and pathetic consumer services ##  why amazon is boarding these kind of wreckless and useless companies in their commercial site... Amazon also should take some steps against this kind of anti consumer activities ####   Good battery backup ####   Worth the money...Go for it after reading specifications clearly ####   Overall decent product. ####    Just received. Device keeps rebooting. ####    It's very bad.... The window is not opening and even if for some reason it is opening ##  it closes in 2 seconds  ##  why? And it's only been 1 week since I  bought the laptop. ####   worst product. not working. always reboot problem and never stays on and reboots again and again. never worked since purchase. ####   Laptop RDP Thinbook people ####   Thanks Mr. Srikant sir & also service team ####   We can add extra Hard disk ##  screen quality and performance average because of normal processor ####   Bought for online classes but battery was missing. I asked for replacement ##  even delivery boy come for replace but meanwhile refused because replacement is not working in this clause. Customer care said to refund  but not able to replace. Due to this my purpose of purchasing this product get failed. ####   Most worst product ##  my being an Amazon customer since 8 years ##  due to this ##  fradulence activity of fake product by amazon I will drag them to Consumer forum ##  remain assured ####   Laptop on/off continue pl suppot me ####   The product is not working properly.got some issue with the on-off system.please guide me about the warranty and authorized people to get it repaired. ####   Became complaint within one month use. ####   I have purchased on 7th Jul ##  with 15 days hard ware failed  ##  i have request to manufacture to replace but they not agreed to replace.  Same time they have done repairs it has been taken 10 days to return the product. Finally the same issue come again with in 1 month and I raised ticket through support mail but no one response in time. ####   Don't believe this Company in after Sales Service ##  as they don't have the quality after Sales service...it's a long time process involve...nd no proper response for....u may think for this that u r begging for a after sales service while u have the right for this...don't buy this laptop ##  its a cheater company in laptop quality nd in after sales service....I may go for it to consumer forum court... ####   I don't use this pc before use this is not working there on off botton is not working ## ..this is just waste of money.. I hate this... ####    Not open leptop screen ####   Worst purchase ## in 2 months  ## gone dead.service center not tespondinhm ####   Display is not working. A very bad product. Please do not buy it. It is only 7 days old ####   Whom to contact for free service? ####   BILL OF LAPTOP IS NOT RECIEVED ALONGWITH WARRANTY CARD OF ONE YEAR ##  SO HOW ITS WARRANTY MAY BE CLAIMED IN FUTURE. ####    After 2 months of using this laptop daily ##  the keyboard has stopped working. Tried to contact the customer executive ##  they say they'll arrange a pick-up for the repair but no response after that. Worst buy in Amazon. ####   I had brought this laptop for my kids online classes. The laptop is running smoothly and he is enjoying his online classes. It's very light in weight and the screen quality is also good. Value for money. It's been more than a month we are using it and than I am posting this review. Batter life is also good. ####   Every thing is good. ####   Perfectly fitted with the purpose of my Grand Son and his online classes. ####   Laptop is very slow for daily college student activities. The customer care service for this company is very poor. ####   इसका स्पीकर एक बराबर नहीं था  ##  fm की माफिक आवाज आती है बोले तो खर्ररेररर ....try 2 improve...RDP😕😕😕 ####   Value for money ##  helpful for online web use. ####   All got what specified ####   First of all RDP laptop is very good. But the seller (Appario Retail Private limited) is very bad. Seller sent me a used and damaged product at first ##  and I had to replace it. Thanks to Amazon for fast and hazel free replacement policy. ####   If anyone want to use Google Meet keep away from this laptop because it processor never ready to handle the processing the Video Audio & WIFI connection at one time but if you use ZOOm App its working well. And other thing it's touchpad touch sensor & Right click are OK but Left key not working properly. Otherwise Its good I checked it with Windows 11 which is quite well run in this laptop & Youtube also working well & it has TPM module so ##  no issue arises at the time of Update it to Windows 11 Pro. ####   Great for everyday stuff like watching videos ##  using ms office ##  emails ##  online classes  ## mspaint etc. Definitely not for installing IDE ##  frw for programming ##  but nowadays there are lots of online platforms for programming which can be used with this laptop ####   Good one to buy ##  but you want to add SSD. ####   Dislike ####   Good ####    Good ####   Camera quality was poor. ####    It's working only 11days. Then start to screen flickering now it's re-starting problem ####   Good for WFH ##  projects ##  online classes purposes etc  worth for money ##  good customer care  support ##  any issues they will assist us and contact them through their Website. ####   I used this product for 2 hours ##  i was happy ##  lightweight ##  sleek ##  all setup and all done. but then next time it won't start ##  so maybe the OS got a problem. so i am returning it ##  but very hopeful replacement will be good. ####   In this packge microsoft is not installed. ####   It’s only been a month since we got this. Initially it was ok for online classes but now it doesn’t work at all. It’s stuck at the starting screen which shows RDP and doesn’t move beyond that. I’ve tried ringing call centre but that doesn’t connect either. Don’t fall for the cheap price ##  it’s not going to last you long so avoid this one! ####   I would not suggest anyone to buy this product. It is service is hights of waste. ####   I purchased new laptop on 3rd Aug 2021.its speaker is not working .only voice is coming Earphone. please give me some solution. ####    Press any key in fulltime and on its on but when we release the key it will be auto power off showing screen and restart automatically....now iam doing reset ####   I was looking for cheaper laptop but was worried about quality. Reading some of reviews I took the chance. I spoke with RDP Service Head. Then I purchased. I have used for more than 2 weeks now. ####   This company device we purchase this year's  this not worth device and also poor services. I have attached pictures in the review. It display broken I called company they attend only one  Attend call after that they no respons. It is not good quality. So don't buy this company products plz ####   I have purchase this for online class. ####   I would suggest not to buy anything from RDP. I have one laptop and having problem with the battery. I asked them to give an offer for replacement which I can do my self or send engineer to my location. But they want me to send the laptop to their factory at anantapur by courier.. just for replacing s battery I need to send the laptop to factory and that too on my own expanse. ####   Good product but without hdd ####   Bought this laptop after seeing good reviews ##  but it is not. Received the box in damaged condition and also seal tampered. On complaining to customer care ##  they told to use the laptop and if any problem occurs can be returned. The mouse touchpad doesn't work properly ##  but the customer care could not be reached. And also no one contacted for installation of the product ##  eventhough it was assured by Amazon. ####    Verry bad ##  ##  bhai parsan kar rhe ho riplace kar do please m bhut parsan hu 🙏🙏 ####   Initially was a bit sceptical about the brand name ##  but other reviews helped me pick it and give a try. Product is value for money. As of now it's being used mostly for online schooling by my son. Could easily fit in hard disk from my older laptop which just gave access to all my older data. ####   Web cam -bad quality ####   Laptop reatarting 8th day product purchace what to do please tell ####   Laptop ended up with booting issues in just two weeks. No Service centre's even in metro cities. Will never recommend this. ####   Beautiful device. But it doesn't have an inbuilt HDD which needs to be bought separately by customer. ####   Thanku this Amazing Laptop ####   I like the product.. it's quality is gud.. nice features...thanks ####   It’s been only 12 days i got this laptop and my laptop automatically shuts down while working and i have to press the windows button to start it and when it turns on if i release the windows and the x button it shuts down again.. need an immediate assistance .. ####   Good Product worth for money ##  no issue on a laptop ##  worth of this price. ####   Stop working in 1st week and then almost 3 week of struggle to avail warranty. ####   Good laptop ####   No local support available in case of hardware issues very surprising since they say in warranty on site support available ####    Display problem on staring windows ####   Horrible Support. ####   We had purchased 2 pc. but were disappointed. Windows was not activated. Speaker was automatically making noise. Don't go for such product as it will give you headaches."},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 10th Gen Intel Core i3 15.6\" (39.62cm) HD Thin & Light Laptop (8GB/256GB SSD/Windows 10/MS Office/2 Year Warranty/Platinum Grey/1.85Kg) ##  81WE01P5IN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹55 ## 890.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹20 ## 400.00 (37%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available* Disclaimer-*The Windows 11 upgrade will be delivered late 2021 into 2022.

This laptop is good for students of school as well as for students for college. It has privacy camera sutter which I like the most. ####   DVD Rom was must ####   Camera quality ####   This lap works for me. ####   Battery was very low ####   Light weight with required performance. ####   Battery - Good ####   No backlight keyboard as it was mentioned in the features. camera quality is just okay. It is Light in weight and is working fine as of now. Speaker output is low. There is no special feature in this laptop feels as if i paid lil extra. ####   Camera quality is suboptimal ####   Good product but not Hard drive but only SSD... ####   Camera stopped working within 6 months  ##  surprised the quality of the camera used in Lenova laptops ####   Pros-1)performance  is very good due to ssd. ####   Bought this couple of months ago.. delivery on time ####   MS Excel is not working ####   Worst laptop ##  don't buy it ##  a week of use and display got deemed and saw a space between screen and the border of the screen. ####   Good laptop for personal use in low budget ####   I've been using this laptop since July 2020 and honestly ##  Lenovo's quality has amazed me. I've always been a fan of IdeaPad's keys - they flow effortlessly with one's typing speed. Screen brightness maybe a problem if you use it outdoors but fast boot-ups and decent display quality compensates for it. At this price point ##  the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3i is easily among the top 3 picks. ####   Best laptop ####   Ultimate ####   Third class laptop I ever bought.... Always ####   Not satisfied battery not getting charge more than 60% and no run more than 30 to 45 minutes ####   The product is a overall package and it is best for the daily use  ##  i am a management student so i get a lot of assignments and projects  ##  i have a lot of research work to persue so i think this system has never been slow  ## it works perfect. ####   Go for something better. The laptop has begun giving multiple issues within the first few months. ####   very bad product  ## within three months keyboard damaged ####   Not good I have battery problem with this products how I can contact with customer care services ####   I don't like ####   Nice laptop but it is really heavy. No laptop bag provided which is necessary for every laptop dealer ####   Camera quality is bad. Not even comparable to a 5000 rupee phone.  Battery life is excellent. ####   Battery 🔋 quality is very very  poor. 100% charge not even last for1hrs. This is manufacturig defect product..... Since. Return window is closed  I have no option left after then repair it.... ####   Good one . But the camera is very poor ####   Although Microsoft office was included there ##  i am unable to get it properly and get some error message like chand your product key. Moreover my camera is not working ####   Best to carry around. Lightweight ####   I am writing here after 3 months of use. The performance is only average and I got problems with the OS and keypad multiple times . I work an average of 2-3 hours a day on this laptop. When I try to open any item it open the property box. Upon searching I found out the Alt key is stuck and I need to change the keypad. I could never get peace with it after buying it. ####   My brand new laptop now lying like a paper weight.  I have requested service almost 10 days b4..no action as of this date.  Very poor service.  Do not buy any lenova product. ####   Better for light work like browsing ##  ms office and multitasking ##  bettery performance little bit poor ##  otherwise everything is awesome. ####   Over all a decent computer. Though it feels very delicate. Built quality could have been better.. ####   An awesome piece ##  with long battery life ##  good camera ##  light weight and super quick. Never heats up. I must say my first experience with Lenovo. Thank you Amazon and thank you Lenovo for giving me this precious baby. ####   The customer supprot is pathetic ##  i registered complaint but there is no update on it for 3 days. ####   Good ####   Everything  is working  nicely ##   good  laptop ####   Laptop back and keyboard are bulit with very cheap material ##  I wasn't expecting that after paying 37k ##  laptop does feel light and description says things which laptop doesn't have. So basically I would recommend asus in just two 2k extra your getting finger print ##  hdd + SSD bigger screen with less bezels unlike lenovo ##  infact this model doesn't have internal cable which connects extends storage and mother board. You will have to go to lenovo store spend another 5-10k to install drive because that cable is not available in open market. Service center says you can install the ram and SSD by yourself and lenovo says if you do so you will void the warranty. So basically a zero to lenovo thumbs down ####   Battery life and camera is letting down this machine. I would recommend HP over lenovo. ####   Battery backup is very poor ####   Battery backup is not so good but overall performance is ok. ####   I just  purchased this system for my school for attending online class. things needs to be improved is : Battery got exhausted quickly ##  it does'nt go beyond 2 1/2  hrs in a strech which is very disappointing to see these day. Webcam quality is not good.  Pixels are distorted in his zoom /MS Team class. Even it is i3 10th Gen with 250 SSD ##  speed of the system is not upto mark. We have not checked it on games or video either. I have exchange it after not satisfied with previous one. Finding same problem. Might be other Customers will find better product. ####   Looks very nice. Worth for money. Very light weight ####   For the cost ##  it meets the purpose. ####   Worst charger design. Not recommended for any one. ####   It's  ok ####   All are good but  ##  I didn't get pre-installed antivirus in it. It's battery life is not good😵😵 ####   Very good for home user. ####   Very Light weight laptop and give smooth performance. ####   Advantages for laptop ##  ####   The laptop is fast durable and very light weight and it has the power of Intel Core i3 10 Gen Chip so it's way faster then the 8 or 9 Gen Chips. ####   The keyboard started malfunctioning only after 1-2 weeks of normal usage. The screen keeps blinking. Not a good product. ####   Really good product ####   Very Good product for this price range. 35650 ####   I would have given 0 star to this laptop. It has worst battery backup ##  very poor screen and webcam. ####   Laptop is okay overall but looks like the body is made of very cheap plastic and the keyboard is worst just use of 3 days the keys came out don't buy it ####   Poor product ####   very bad exprience. autometic power on problem faceing . . ####   Disappointed with camera but overall all pretty good ####   Good quality ####   Super ####   Nice laptop for coding ####   I purchased it for my son. I good product from Lenovo. Really impressed by its speed and smooth functioning. USB Type C would have made it most desirable laptop for its price. ####   Very Poor Build Quality ####   Resolution issues. Painful to the eyes ##  I am simply not able to use it  Its a week since I bought. No help from Amazon yet ##  neither replacement nor a solution. ####   Good purchase at right time. Good value for money 💰 ####   initial first hand review... just arrived..smooth feel ##  smooth setup..very light. feel good. balance i will update after use ####   Speakers volume is very low.and not satisfied with camera quality at all i expect a change policy feom your side. ####   Not so good ####   Very pathetic response by amazon customer centre....it has only 200 gb memory ...poor camera ## very poor sound quality ## and i purchased it today..but amazon customer centre said they can't  help me out..just go to lenovo and asked them why they made it 200 gb memory laptop ####   4 gb ram : don't buy this even for school studies. Its too slow. Camera is also not that great . ####   Battery life is unbelievable and camera too. I Haven't expect such premium featured laptop in such cheap price. Lucky me! 😆 i got it for 35k. Just go for it. ####   Thank you ####   Light weight ##  slim ## battery ok. Camera is a joke. ####   The Laptop is Good in general and overall.It is very fast in boot up & shut down in less than 15 sec.The given windows 10 with Office is very Good with several update features.Several minor inconveniences are there as follows : It comes with single 256 gb SSD and in it windows would ever need more than some 50gb.Leaving that Lenovo should have created a part of 200gb as separate virtual disc for user convenience and safety of system.But they left it as single open disc.For General users it will be hard job to create a virtual disc needing expert services .This system can accomodate one more SSD for increasing storage capacity but no where details provided as required for user how to install it.They should have exclusively provided info on this.All 3 usb ports + HDMI port all inline beside power adopter point at left side.Seems like a design for left handers.Such like this provision is not convenient.For cable mouse left to right cable has to run around for a Right hander.It boasts of a finger print reader in power button but no where it is mentioned how to set it.Other than these points well satisfied with this Laptop and hope it will give expected service life. ####   Pros- Good product. Smooth functioning. FHD. Light weight. ####   Nice laptop ## Superb speed ## battery life approx 4 hrs. ####   Got this delivered on 19th aug'20. The packaging inside was fine however ##  the amazon box was open from one side when delivered. ####   Perfect for students ####   I liked everything except color reproduction. The display quality is extremely good ##  bu the lack of a balanced saturation and vibrancy make the images look dull and desaturated. Thus the film viewing experience is not that great.  But apart from that its a pretty amazing and decent laptop at this price range. ####   Value for money ##  good speed for multi tasking ##  Light weight sufficient battery life. ####   I am facing audio issues after 10-15 days of buying this product. Rest is quite good."},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP 14 (2021) Thin & Light 11th Gen Intel Core i3 Laptop with Alexa Built-in ##  8GB RAM ##  512GB SSD ##  14-inch(35.5 cm) FHD Screen ##  Windows 10 ##  MS Office (14s-dr2015TU)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹55 ## 999.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹9 ## 009.00 (16%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available* Disclaimer-*The Windows 11 upgrade will be delivered late 2021 into 2022.

Very fast charging ##  gr8 looks and display is good. Overall a best buy with exchange and its latest generation i5 processor 2021 ####   I bought this on 11th August. It worked fine but from last 4-5 days I'm experiencing alot of issues with the device. It keeps on loading browsers. I'm using a wifi with 150 mbps speed and got my wifi repaired too because I thought it's an internet issue but don't know what has happened. It hardly opens any browser online and I've also reset my PC 2 times to avoid this but it's still the same. @Lenovo ##  please look into this. ####    Display problem.. ####   It just got something all in one features.....Worth buying 👍 ####   Nothing ####   Received it today ie 19th August 2021. You could see in the pic that the screen has a line on the left side which runs from top to bottom. Amazon has extended the courtesy of replacing it in two days. ####   Performance is really good. ####   First impressions: ####    Screen flickering problem I wants to refund immediately. ####   My first leptop so nice ####   Laptop seems good. Simple laptop with all the configurations as mentioned. Lookwise First impression is good. Office and windows are full version. It takes 15-20 seconds to boot up. ####   Description of the item doesn't clearly state whether MS office is trial or full version. It is Trial version only ####    I have purchased #LenovoIdeapad3 ####   Good ####   Good Quality and excellent price value. ####   Battery performance low.. ####   Nice product. ####   Good value for money ####   Battery backup is not good need improvement in this ####    Within one month it stopped working .had issues with it from date of purchase. ####   Overall I like the laptop and best suits it’s price. ####   Nice product and good service by the seller. ####   Light weight with amazing design ##  value for money ####   No installation service provided even after several follow ups. Amazon should take responsibility of end to end service. ####   You get exactly what the photos in the description depict. ####   Camera isn't working ##   battery is disgusting before dispatching they should make themselves satisfy in all aspects whatever mentioned in brochure. I think sometimes they remove some aspects and send. Layman like me catch them very late I am not familiar with laptop so slowly I will come to know of other things of the laptop ####   It is in deep a good laptop with excellent display and amazing speed. ####   Awesome ####   BATTERY PERFORMANCE IS VERY LOW > 1 HOURS. DO NEEDFUL FOR SUPPORT ####   I am unable to start the laptop ##  my laptop is only 10 days old ##  I took it to the service centre. The service team tried to start the laptop by using another new power adaptor without success ##  even my power adaptor was not adequately charging another sample laptop. This is a new product ##  please send in a replacement of the laptop ##  I don't want a defective laptop ##  where parts are replaced and it still does not function optimally. ####   Hangs up many times ####   Thanx a lot for the product delivery.  Received in very gud condition. ####   Lcd screen broken after one year of use . ####   Really good ####   The display resolution is very poor if you guys are working on graphic related please do/'t but this laptop ##  Also Battery life is maxed 2 Hrs after done 100% ####   My laptop stopped working twice in first 4 months and I tried reaching out to customer care through various channel but no help. Never ever buy LENOVO ##  at least this brand. ####   Not a good mobile at all - hanging issue is the biggest issue ####   Best of best ####   Best product in the class ####   Very very poor battery life. Camera quality is terrible. I'm planning to go for replacement. Battery is not going above 60%. It is not retaining charge for more than half an hour. Pls don't get cheated by buying this product. I can't attend online classes when there's no power supply. As soon as the power fails ##  it gets shut down. It seems the return window closed within 1 month of purchase ####   The product is great ####   Battery life worst ####   DIsplay damaged after 2 months of purchase ####   I had purchased this 2 months back. And I really had a good experience with it. Battery life is awesome. And all in-built features are really great. But we need to compromise with the camera quality and thickness as all the available features of this product with such low cost is really rare. ####   Good laptop ####   Not even a month since I bought this...on one fine day I received notification that hardisk malfunctioned.  it was taken to Lenovo service center a month back ##  I haven't received it yet. I was informed by service centre that the hardisk needs replacement. Officials from Lenovo service centre are not at all bothering to service (they took incharge for hardisk replacement) ##  and the reason is ##  it was bought from online store. I lost my 38k rupees. Though I have warranty ##  I have to spend my  money for the replacing hardisk as there is no response from Lenovo service center...they are least bothered. I am an Amazon customer for the past 6 years and is this the way I am paid back?? I am disgusted. Amazon is unreliable for expensive products. The same happened with a phone I bought a few years back.  I'm in need of laptop for my child's online class and the only reason I bought from Amazon is because of covid pandemic. There is a great demand for laptops in store. Amazon has cost me so much money. I am literally fed up. ####   The product lives upto the specs. Quite good in the price range. ####   Nice product ####   It has a very good battery backup. ####   Really fast and smooth to use. Was expecting a metal body but the plastic is very sturdy too. ####   Shopkeeper suggested me for engineering and for programming. The processer speed was osm but only fault is with battery it typically lasts only 3hrs and camera quality is avg. If performamce is your choice rather than batterylife than go for it. plz dont buy seriously battery is very bad. ####   Don't buy it ####   After going through so many reviews finally I have purchased this laptop. Believe me you will never regret of selecting this laptop. Battery stands about 4 hours in full use ##  booting time is 10sec max ##  genuine Windows and Office......what else required. ####   I am sharing my review after 2 month..and product is awasome. But battery life is little bit disappointed other wise great for buying this laptop. ####   No issues with the overall laptop but the camera stopped working after 2 months of usage. Lenovo ##  already the camera quality is too bad. In this age of gazillions mega pixel camera quality in puny mobile phones why can't u get urselves a reality check and embed a better hardware in ur laptops?!! ####   Good product ####   I bought this laptop 2 months ago and the below comments came from my real work experience. ####   Very bad camera went in 40 days no person com9to repair inspire of warranty took to Andheri told to take backup and leave 15 days very disappointing ####   I have been delivered a defective laptop. Even after complaint with Lenevo no customer support. ####   Working fine. There is no any problem ####   Good laptop ####   Nice as expected... Good performance ####   Overall a good product at this price. Camera quality is not great. ####   Camera quality is poor and battery life very bad hardly full charge laptop goes for 3hrs ####   The display suddenly stopped working. Its all comming black screen. Hardly see  the login option. I put complain with Lenovo service request  no is. 8015722964 status is not changing. Its been 1 week now I am not able to use my laptop. Very poor service by lenovo. There is no direct contact to reach out to support team. Its a very bad experience I have ever had. ####   Performance is really Impressive ##  best product in affordable price ##  battery life is OK ##  overall it's amazing in this budget! ####   Good for this price. ####   Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3i Intel Core i5 10th Gen 15.6 FHD Thin and Light Laptop> ####   Good ******purchased two laptop of same make within 15days. Helpful for the kids nowadays for their smooth and easy functions. ####   Lenovo IdeaPad 3i ####   Battery life is too poor ####   No LAN but wifi strong enough ####   It's nice but battery life is no long it gives full charge for 3hours only it's nice with best features for that cost ####   The packaging of the laptop was very poor hai the screen of the laptop was defective and was having patches ####   Good product ####   Summary after use - ####   Overall good device. ####   I have purchased around 6+ laptops within 3 months the keyboard stopped working. Now when I am asking for service there is no proper response. ####   People who want LAN acess dont but it becoz it doest have any LAN port ####   Overall good machine but very poor camera resolution and quality ####   it's brilliant working with the laptop for my office work. I am completely satisfied with the keyboard style it is apt for office purpose and study purpose. ####   its overall good i buyed this laptop from offline i didnt buy this laptop from amazon but i have the same variant only a slight different is  i have mx130 nvidia ge force graphics and its good for gaming like need for speed most wanted ####   Backlit available or not we need it it is compulsory for us so kindly inform it is available or not ####   Over all good product with build in OS to operate the moment we received with simple ease of registration steps. ####   The battery charging was dried up very quickly.With 100% charging we can  work for 3 or less hours only. ####    Poor quality and not at all response from Lenovo service center ####   Camera quality is worst (maximum of 0.3 MP). In my opinion ##  this product is a big waste of money. ####   Taking more time while switching between processing"},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 2021 Intel Core i5 11th Gen 14\" (35.56cm) FHD IPS Thin & Light Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Windows 10/MS Office/Backlit/Fingerprint Reader/2 Yr Warranty/Arctic Grey/1.41kg) ##  82H700KTIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹74 ## 390.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹16 ## 400.00 (22%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available* Disclaimer-*The Windows 11 upgrade will be delivered late 2021 into 2022.

Anyways just loved it.. ####   Best ####   I have bought this system around a month back. ####   My review of Legion 5 Pro AMD 5800 ##  RTX 3060 ##  16 GB RAM. Mediatek Wifi (Very important spec :p) ####   Ok so this is a great gaming laptop no doubt... ####   the laptop whole package is awesome. although its a bit pricey you get 3 year warranty and you get qhd 500 nits screen and 6gb graphics nvidia rtx model and msoffice 2019 included with the price and also get highly customizable feature rich and visually attractive bios and lenovo vantage app and x-rite colour assistant app which are used for controlling software and hardware settings and features. ####   You can get the exact same specifications in asus for 1 ## 20 ## 000 /- inr . ####   Beast in gaming ####   Awesome. Works quite well. Loved the features. Has the latest generation tech as of today ####   I bought this laptop for all round work(study ##  gaming and content creation) ####   Even after reading several negative views from customers ##  decided to trust ##  the brand ##  the seller and Am7azon. Received faulty laptop today morning. Display didn't start. Talked for an hour with Lenovo Customer Service. Who has promised an inspection and possible replacement... ####   Overall laptop is very good. But the realtek wifi card is the worst thing about this. It should have been intel ####   Its just awesome  ##  i didn't faced any keyboard backlight issues but i didn't found the lighting control first but after the update its available  ##  and every thing is good but my only concern is the touchpad wabbling a little bit and thats it  ##  its not a problem though  ##  built like a tank and just loved it ####   This is a superb Laptop but there is only one problem this laptop ship's with slower memory this is the only problem i thought ####   They could have also offered a lower specced variant with 512GB of SSD and MS DOS instead of Windows 10 ##  since many of us are upgrading our older laptops which have an SSD with Windows installed on it. ####   The Legion 5 Pro is an absolute beast of a computing machine! The thermals are excellent even in the scorching Indian summers ##  the 2560*1600 16:10 display with VESA certified HDR400 is a marvel to look at ##  and the build quality is as solid as it gets for a gaming laptop. The entire laptop has a metallic finish and feels solid to the touch. The rubber stands underneath the laptop are deep enough to allow for considerable airflow but I would recommend raising the back atleast a few inches during intense gaming sessions. The keyboard has a soft-touch finish to it and it is a pleasure to type on. ####   Every feature of this laptop is amazing. But the RGB keyboard has some serious issues.  It's not getting customized in the Lenevo Vantage app as well via the keybaord shortcut. This is a global issue with a lot of units. You can find the same issue on Lenevo website forums in detail. Few other buyers here on amazon mention the same issue as well. ####   Excellent performance for both gaming and productivity tasks. ####   Lenovo Legion5 -PRO is highly recommended ##  its the only laptop worth buying for its price point ##  got mine delivered by amazon in 4 days ##  been using it for 2 weeks ##  comes with a surprise 3 year warranty by default. ####   Buy this laptop only if its in sale  ##  because the performance your are getting from that price is very high ####   Best for Gaming ####   Be aware before buying!!! Laptop’s igpu not working ##  screen flickers a lot and amd drivers not detecting igpu so i had to refund my product and this is a serious issue some time keyboard rgb not working ..otherwise laptops performance is vey good lenovo should fix this igpu problem..thank u ####   The laptop's built quality of top-notch and full metal alloy construction. Keyboards has good travel distance and no!!! There is no RGB lighting problem. Check attached pics. ####   its good ####   I disliked nothing and i liked everything ####   The legion 5 pro is. a beast ####   The pros of this laptop have been covered in detail. It is a fantastic laptop. However 2 cons of this laptop : ####   (1 month usage update below) ####   Received the laptop today and it is as just as in the description i.e. just wonderful and amazing. The only thing is that delivery guy brought the package to me without the box from Amazon but it was sealed so accept it and Amazon must be careful from next as laptops are fragile so maximum protection is needed. Also ##  while buying the laptop from Amazon they didn't seems to send the bag as well which is a disadvantage means you need to purchase bag seperately overall there is no issues with the laptop or anything and if you need a gaming laptop just go for this one and won't regret it. ####   Gaming - You can't find better than it in the whole world within this price range! ####   What a beauty. In love with the screen and this beast is insanely fast. Ssd inside is too good. ####   Can't change RGB. Stuck in rainbow loop. On the verge of returning. ####   I purchased this from a Lenovo certified offline store at Nehru Place. ####   Initially thought that the 16\" laptop was a bit bulky ##  but it turned around to be much like any other 15.6\" laptop as the bezzels are so thin. ####   Excited for this one! ####   This is the best gaming performance I've had from a system ever. Moving from Nitro 5 to this has been a heavenly experience. Tried a few games ##  some GPU heavy and some CPU heavy and wasn't disappointed. ####   Display and built quality are the best of all which stands out with its competitors. I spent some time playing valorant at medium settings. The cpu temp goes to 75 degrees and GPU temp goes to 60 degrees. You will definitely notice a difference in the display. It's the best display a gaming laptop has.i didn't any fps drops. ####   I'd pre-ordered the laptop when it lauched and was super excited to check it out when it arrived before the specified date. ####   There is no option to change lighting pattern or customize the behaviour in lenovo vantage software. Key shortcut is also not working. ####   Pre ordered and got it on 7th August. ####   Products brought from Amazon comes with only one year warranty only. Trying to resolve the issue . ####   I like everything in this lappy. BTW price 😔 dissatisfied ## but it has a lot of excellent specifications and its mainly designed for gaming"},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS ROG Strix G17 (2021) 17.3-inch (43.94 cms) FHD 144Hz ##  AMD Ryzen 7 4800H ##  GTX 1650 4GB Graphics ##  Gaming Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Windows 10/Gray/2.4 Kg) ##  G713IH-HX020T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹1 ## 02 ## 990.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹32 ## 000.00 (31%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available.

It has got a slow processor.... It hangs on platforms like zoom... You need to have a lots of patience to wait for your mails getting loaded... It's mic stops working abruptly and start working again in its own.... When I took it to the service centre they asked me to put one more device in it for better speed.... That was worth rps 7000....i already spent do much money on this laptop and still I need to add more items to it for better functioning... Moreover it is not reliable when I have to take online meetings.... Very disappointed with the product.... Now only used by my daughter for watching YouTube kids ####   It's very good product yo use and for coding ####   Laptop is as per the description provided. Battery back up for work is good ##  but for continuous video calls of school ##  it drains in an hour. But overall it is a good buy for the value.. I got it for 33 ## 000/- ####   Very bad experience ##  bought  a Laptop ##  delivered faulty item and now not taking back. Tried five times to return it ##  either pick up person would not come or he would simply deny to pick it up. Seems bad intention. Not recommend to buy any costly item ##  specially electronic item from Amazon. ####   Value for money ####   Not fully used. ####   Loved it ####   Automatically power on after open the laptop ####   Nice product ####   camera quality is very poor.Very slow to start. just ok for own use. ####   Really facing an issue with this laptop ## was late by one day ## cant return it ## lap is being too laggy ####   Since processor speed is low ##  we can expect the same poor performance. ####   Don't go for it ! ####   Not very satisfied with the laptop... It says Dolby Audio but very poor sound quality. No sound at all... Screen quality is average. ####   Device is very nice but delivery is very unexpected because whenever I have order from Amazon the product comes within 2 days ####   The Laptop is below par. Actually I bought it in exchange of my HP i3 old generation but sometimes it feels this is even slow than that old one. ####   Great looks good got this in 31 ## 740👍 ####    Got it for 34 ## 999. Exchanged my VAIO i5 2011 model. Works really good. It is for my brother who is in school. So ##  not a heavy user. But still everything works great. Even we installed GTA 4 and it runs smooth with a bit of graphic changes. Smoother than my i5 8th gen.

The laptop is very light and well built. ####   Best laptop ..best budget. Best screen . Moreover best warranty than all of competitors . Go for it and leave Dell or HP or others ####   Single hand open is the best!! ####   I got it at 82990  ##  mainly for media consumption purpose  ##  for that is perfect. ####   Laptop with ####   It heats a lot for basic tasks  ##  i5 i a piece of garbage combined with the non existent fan of LG gram makes it worse (evo certification is just for putting basic things right  ##  it doesn’t guarantee everything ####   Got it 4 days ago. Light weight. Be cautious while working on it by the side of a window…it may fall due to the air coming in.  Audio is a little less due to positioning of the speakers beneath the base. Performance is ok. ####   its very nice product and very light weight. easy to handle.. ####   Its a very well built ultra light 17 inch laptop. ####   best laptop ##  battery backup more than 10 hrs  ##  fast  ##  doesn't lag  ##  u have to be careful with the screen it is very delicate ####   Cant ask for more. A handfull of laptop. Simply the best laptop computer I have used so far. Battery does not last as advertised. But I get a decent 10 plus hours backup. In the last one week ##  I charged it only twice. Screen is a very big plus. Very clear and nice display. I reduce the resolution to use my engineering drawings and bring it back to recommended setting after my work is done. We need to wait for all apps to catchup with this resolution. Keyboard and touchpad are fluid. Fingerprint is a breeze. Some bloatware found. I uninstalled some and kept some that that I felt is of use. Speakers are quite good. I read reviews and saw videos and was waiting for a disastrous sound. But the sound is quite good. Most importantly ##  we can hear a full surround sound from these two speakers. The spacing is such that it feels like listening through headphones due to the size of the laptop. ####   Bought the laptop after lot of research.. my main criterias while searching for a laptop were large high resolution display (to view medical images) ##  portability and fast processing.. This one has won in all three.. Very satisfied with this purchase.. Thanks LG and Amazon.. ####   Superb ##  light weight with17\" screen ##  almost full day battery back up ##  very good kwality product from LG ##  love this it ####   top rated screen ####   Simply Value For Money Laptop ####   its been a week ##  the laptop works fine ##  as mentioned is super light ##  even compared to 14/13\" laptop ##  but thats why it is flimsy ##  you will have to be careful plugging charging cable or usb into its ports. ####   Can be better if it has 16 GB RAM. It is very fast and good to work. ####   Very good battery ##  Big screen ##  light weight ##  screen is high resolution but very straining to eyes ##  UV filtration is very bad compared to other laptops ####   Buy Apple MacBook instead. Don't go for LG. It is pathetic in quality and service. Go for MACBOOK AIR M1 ####   Superfast ##  Very slim and lightweighted for this screensize. ####   Earlier I was thinking of getting the 11th gen version but its coming with LPDDR5 so the RAM won't be upgradable. ####   Very competent package. ####   1 lakh me without dedicated GPU... My opinion don't buy... Buy any apply macbook on this price range thank you... ####   I have been looking for this laptop for a few months but have not bought it previously as I already have an HP high configuration Laptop but finally decided to buy it. ####   Really light ##  superb display. ####   The product is good for it's price in India. Obviously it is almost 30k higher than what it is in the US but that's what most fo the laptop companies do in India. The tax diffrences are not that big to create such a price difference but unfortunately most of the companies use this tactics in India. ####   I didnt know that LG also makes laptop.

Bad product ####   I am sharing this review after purchasing laptop from local shop where I get best deal.. here are some genuine reason why you with pros and cons.. ##  ####   Good Battery life ##  snappy performance (any time I had minimum 15 chrome tabs open along with 3-4 other apps. No lag. ####   Everything is awesome good for students and little gaming and it has and issue i face when i was updated the update  ## The battery percentage from 100% it went to 25% in half an hour and the speakers are shit better get a pair of earphone ####   I love all over design of laptop thin and lightweight and performance of this laptop is unbelievable its full fill my all requirements but price range higher because when we see on acer official website price are low and always show out of stock over all acer doing very well in term of body we got aluminum top and backlit keyboard ####   We had purchased for our son and he just loved using the laptop for everyday use ##  Coding ##  watching videos ##  attending webinars and attending his classes online. The battery backup is amazing and the Laptop overall is just awesome. No issues as of now connecting to Wifi 2.5 ghz/ 5 ghz band. Since we have Airtel broadband the Wifi autoconnects to highest 5 ghz band and is super fast. Laptop opens up super fast and depends on if we have configured any login password or personalised photos/background during Laptop login page ##  based on which little difference may be seen but overall great processor for faster access to anything to be done with this laptop. Not has an opportunity to contact ACER for any issue as Laptop is working great. Thank You. ####   Very sleek...light weight...very fast... ####   Used it for a week and.... ####   Product as mentioned ####   I was eyeing for this laptop since its announcement. ####   Speaker and camera ####   I found this Laptop on ACER and Croma site at night for 53K and 52K. Being sleepy ##  I left it and next morning it was out of stock on both. Then I bought it on Amazon for 56K less 1K discount for HDFC card. ####   Everything's great in this machine. ####   Amazing display ##  good battery backup ####   The 5500U is ##  to slightly put it ##  ABSOLUTELY BONKERS ##  Gives even the Current Generation i7s ##  (dare I say i9s) a run for their money. Compiles the entire Linux kernel in under a minute (If you don't know what that means ##  let me tell you its Performance is Beyond Comprehension) ####   Excellent battery life ##  decent screen with IPS so good viewing angles ##  Lightweight aluminium top body ##  boots up and shuts down in seconds because of 8GB RAM and 512 GB SSD. AMD Radeon Graphics does the job well ##  can play light games. Soft and brisk touchpad. Overall a good package in the price. ####   Good ####   It's a complete waste of money product. Sound Volume and Quality is worst. Build quality is very basic. ####   Good laptop ##  6 core 12 thread's cpu with 8gb soldered ram ##  can be expanded upto 24gb  ##  slot for 2.5 inch hard disk / sata 2.5 inch ssd is given which can be installed upto 2tb ##  mounts are provided for that ##  1080p ips screen and backlit full side keyboard provided though backlit keyboard brightness can't be controlled ##  available for a lesser price ##  check acer online store or offline store. ####   just you look this laptop every things has been provide most important is that acer service centre. Today I have visited with my laptop to install external HDD. what a service just took 5 minutes. Manager Jogesh has tolled me due pandemic I am ready to send my technical staff in my resident. What more you want. Another best quality service of Amazon they have give me this ACER ASPIRE AMD RYZEN 5-5500U laptop within 04 days. Amazon hats off You. Its looks too Good and best keyboard minor sound supposed to be high. Otherwise every parts & function are too excellent. ACER Wishing you all the best .

This has hinges issues which will result into screen damage and other parts. Apart from this HP has highly disappointed post sales services. No value for money....You need to spend more money for getting it repair. I purchased this Laptop in Feb 2021 and Hinges came out in three months without any usages... ####   Happy with the purchase. Awesome product. ####   I am using this laptop since one week. Over-all I am satisfied. Heating problem is there couple of time while high data consumption. But performance of this laptop is too good. ####   display is awesome. size ##  weight ##  flexibility ##  battery  also good. ####   Never purchase a product with HP. Poor quality. I’ve bought my HP ENVY X360 by march. My laptop door got stuck while opening without even a hard handle. I have handled it very carefully each time i used my laptop. Now when i reach support they say that i damaged my laptop and it’s not claimable on warranty. They will rob your money like anything. Customer support is worst. I had a chat with HP support person named Abhishek ##  he kept on coping and pasting messages mentioning the same thing but at last they didn’t answer my question. ####   battery backup is not as clamed to be  ## it last upto 6-7 hrs ####   The laptop is actually good. But I have several issues with ssd and wifi keep on disconnecting. It happened after 20 days of purchase so return window has been closed. In 3 months I have formated my laptop 7 times. ##  ssd motherboard ##  and wifi card has already been changed ##  but still I am getting this problem. ####   An awesome buy!! everything works great!! stylus works very good and ia very responsive. good package by the seller!! loved the product!! ####   Very cute premium product.Works as advertised.Processor better than i5.Only small issue is screen is of  reflective type.Overall I am happy with the lappy.. ####   Right hinge broke after two months of gentle use. The broken hinge hit the screen and cracked it. After long calls and terrible service from HP ##  I was finally told I would have to pay 20k to get the laptop fixed and even though the laptop is under warranty ##  physical damage would not be covered by HP. If it wasn't for the hinge issue and the truly awful customer service by HP ##  I would have given this laptop 5 stars. But sorry to say ##  after this I will never be buying an HP laptop ####   The laptop is overall a great value just make sure you are purchasing the correct size as it seems little smaller if this laptop had a 14 inch display it would have been a perfect laptop ####   The hinge broke and screen is popping out within 3 months of use despite delicate handling. HP doesn't help with warranty claim as they consider it as accidental damage ##  which is not the case. It's the cheap build quality of the plastic used to stabilise the hinge. ####   ## The good. ####   The worst purchase I ever made. Was dead on arrival. ####   Specs are great but the quality seems to be bad. Having speaker issues within 10 days of buying a new laptop. HP service center agreed to change the speakers but even they are not sure if the issue is only due to the speakers. Customer Service is very poor and takes multiple calls to the customer care. This is my 2nd x360 only because the specs looked great and have an HP printer as well. Overall I would not recommend going for HP laptops/products. ####   It's delicate for use ##  battery life not up to the mark and definitely not for heavy task ####   For a simple Battery replacement they took 1 month and still not replaced. Please be careful prior making a buying decision. The HP service is not that effective and friendly. They will simply linger long without any quick resolution. Better try out for other brands like Lenovo/Dell who have 2 days prompt service policy. ####   Very good Laptop for creator ####   I think there is issue with speakers at some point it plays loud and automatically decreases to low I didn't understand where the problem is with speakers or software apart from this issue everything is good ####   Wireless adapter keep missing. Tried to update driver but no use. Only solution is to restart ####   Hinges came out within 3 months before my card emi ends.  Hinges broken on very smooth folding of 360 degrees.  It has very small support between the 2 parts ie ## m monitor and keyboard. ####   Overall ##  laptop is best in term of performance ##  specification ##  and user-friendly. The only problem ##  in table mode if laptop goes to sleep there is no way to wake up the laptop without flipping back to laptop. Although ##  there is an option with the help of digital pen to stick in the lower hing but didn't works everytime. Other than this ##  it's perfect. ####   Best ####   I have used it for a month now. The laptop is a gem. Its fast. Value for money. Touch is good. Great for people requiring two in one laptops. Overall experience is awesome. The only thing that is very average about this laptop is the HP pen and its built quality. Very mediocre built quality considering the price you pay for it. ####   Buy from store ##  costs 74k only ##  suggest you to buy from a store which is nearby. Great laptop thanks you ####    Oneof the best laptop u can buy with a good processor and graphic card... It's new era for RYZEN... byyy byy intel..must have for student ####   I  liked this product very much. It features are very attractive and useful.  the multi- functional. uses  like tablet and laptop is very nice.  The light weight and easily handle with touch screen is beautiful. ####   I've been using this laptop for the past 3 months. Actually ##  I was looking for a 13-inch windows laptop So I bought this ##  and to be honest this is a crazy laptop with good built quality and performance is bonkers. I've binge-watched series in this with external speakers and even used it for my online classes ##  photo editing ##  the battery is very sufficient ##  lasts around 13-14 hours solid. But in mine hinges ##  one side is slightly uneven than the other but they work absolutely fine. No issues so far. Best laptop. If you're looking for a cute ##  powerful ##  handy ##  and efficient laptop ##  go for the HP Envy x360 13 ay0045au. ####   Excellent laptop ####   A dream laptop for most of the people. Has all the specifications and an unmatched performance. ####   The laptop came without OS installed in it. It has major heating issue. You cannot operate for more than 15 mins on your lap. ####   It is a premium machine. Wish battery life was better ####   Ordered as a replacement for my 7 years old HP Pavilion model. This one rocks. Super viewing and listening experience. Form factor is the icing on the cake. Slim bezels. But ##  not suitable for phablet mode usage. Ideal pick for media consumption and ight excel works. Touch screen is not super responsive like it is in the mobile but decent job there too ####   Has a premium feel to it ##  it is compact and lightweight which helps. 3rd Gen Ryzen 5 processors are pretty good ##  rarely an application gets stuck. Serves well for general purpose laptop. Keypads are good ##  soft and easy to adapt. Found the speaker quality decent ##  has Bang & Olufsen speakers ##  quite decent for regular videos ##  don't expect anything fancy in this aspect. ####   Battery life is average we cannot say above average ##  you can play Fortnite ## pubg ##  cod mobile on ultra settings speakers are good ##  the keyboard is good ##  the trackpad is also good ##  the display is good ##  it is the laptop for not very high usage good for light users. When you play games laptop temp goes to 95 degrees celsius. This was shown by and Radeon software already built-in. Again not for heavy usage good for light usage like school work heavy usage like gaming. I bought it from the hp store ##  If you want to do gaming by omen at the same price if you won't use the touchscreen very much. A gaming laptop is better than it has vega 8 integrated graphics  4GB ##  8GB ram non-upgradable. It doesn't support type c charging also which is bad. Thanks! ####   Laptop is making very loud buzzing sound.. it is horrible ####   awesome laptop ##  power full ##  super display ##  nice touch response ##  good build and perfect for entertainment ##  with office work. ####   excellent laptop for students the stylus is nice ##  though the screen is a bit slippery for it. I had purchased it for a basic need but if you need to do graphic intensive work you can prefer HP omen or pavalion series. ####   Laptop is excellent and compact.Touch screen is good and Ryzen processor is much faster than Intel in my view.The network is not picking up sometimes rarely  & system needs a restart.Need to be fixed by HP .otherwise a good Laptop to buy ####   Guys be aware after receiving this  laptop when i checked warrenty online i was shocked because warrenty already started 6 month ago with someone else name so Be careful. ####   Amazing buy. Performance is beyond expectations. Boots up in 3/4 seconds and works without lag. This is expected from pc of this cost but this is beyond expectations. ####   Awesome. Premium in every way. ####   Good buy ####   Absolutely love this 2-in-1 laptop ##  though it cost me above ₹75k ####   A perfect device ####   There is an issue with the Speaker volume - it's inconsistent - probably because of a driver and Windows 10 update conflict. No solution found till now. ####   Great product. Sleek design. Long battery. Amazing styllus ## very light weight. Serves all purposes. Must have for teachers and professionals engaged in presentation ####   I have bought an HP envy x 360 laptop . The serial # of my laptop is CNDO3946SG . I faced an issue with the laptop . The internal speakers stopped working all of a sudden. I called customer support  ##  they troubleshoot it and they said that the technician will be sent to my place  ##  who will fix the problem. After a week I was informed that technician will visit to your place . The technician came and suggested that it is not a hardware issue  ## it is an operating system issue . I was told another technician will visit my place on priority basis as I have waited for a long time. I was assured a technician will visit to my place within 48 hours and he will fix this problem. After waiting for more than a stipulated time ##  I called the customer service to inform them that the. Technician hasn’t visited my place yet and I was waiting for a long time  ##  please resolve this issue as soon as possible. I was informed  that the case has been closed and I was shocked how can they close the case without any communication from them . I called again and I was informed that they can’t help me . I wonder what kind of on-site warranty your company provides to customers . When we need the on-site service we are being delayed and denied . I request you kind take your laptop back and refund me my money so that I will buy a laptop from some good service provider . I am having a worst experience with HP . I will never recommend any of my friends or colleagues to buy anything from HP. I will give my reviews on every social media platforms and I will make sure no other customer suffers as I have. ####   Components and premium  ##  laptop and lightweight and compact. ####   Screen resolution and clarity : superb ####   Great product. Positives: sturdy ##  sleek ##  elegant ##  backlit keyboard ##  touchscreen (with/without stylus) ##  360 degree rotation ##  great battery life ##  strategic positions of speakers. Negatives: definitely overpriced considering the small screen size and AMD processor ####   I am writing this after usage of around two months. So far I am a very satisfied customer. I was initially skeptical about AMD Ryzen but now I can say it is better than intel (on feel factor basis ##  have not done any tests). What do I use it for - browsing (with 10+ tabs and cloud based business Apps running in parallel) ##  Video calls over Teams and Zoom (both video and sound quality is pretty good) ##  office applications (multiple word ##  excel and power point documents remain in open state). key board and touch pad is very smooth and convenient (have pretty thick fingers). Get 8+ hours of battery backup though not tested the limits. ####   This is just excellent product ####   The pen from HP is no where near apple pencil. ####   Like: light laptop for everyday use. Good features intended for creativity with spectacular display. No issues with programming as well; I've used it for coding and image analysis. ####   Laptop is good.. But I got a model whose warranty was registered with 2 month's back start date. That means I have received an old model or an used one whose serial is already being registered on the site ####   This is one good purchase ##  provides decent speed ##  touch screen is smooth ##  bit disappointed with battery ##  with full on usage it at max goes good for 4 hours ####   I think purchasing these product is bettee in offline.i received a damaged product by default ie a dead pixel on the screen and a broken key on the keyboard. Didn't expect to get a too low quality laptop from a brand like hp and sold by Amazon ####   Verry good backup ##  touch is more speed ####   HP Envy x360 user of 4 months. ####   Overall this is a fine product ##  Been using it for the past 15 days turned out really well ####   Purchased this expensive machine only to see that the screen died the very next day. Disappointed ... very disappointed as now I will have to go after all the HP service centre guys to see that it is repaired. ####   Posting the review after using the laptop for 2 months. I am a light user ##  so the battery life is great (~8 hours). The touch screen works amazing. The look and feel of the laptop is elegant. Overall ##  a great purchase for me. ####   Simply Awesome ####   Amazon laptop!!! ####   This ultra book is worthy for its price ####   DO NOT buy this laptop ##  although the whole body is aluminium  ##  but internally where the hinges are screwed to the body ##  that joint is made of plastic. On a fully metal laptop ##  it just makes no sense to do that. It's just a cheap tactic used by the company to reduce the life span of the product so people get it replaced faster and spend more money. ####   Certainly Mind-blowing in all aspects at such a feasible cost ####   Hinge came out within 2 months - with just regular use and no impact one fine day one of the hinge broke apart ... looks like a premium laptop but build wise i have doubts not... ####   I bought this so called premium line from HP just two days back... As I started using it for my business video meetings ##  encountered two big issues: ####   Sleek and beautiful. Got it for my wife. She's loving it. Envy is the perfect name because it's exactly how people who own MacBooks feel when they see it and hear the price. ####   Except the pen ##  rest is value for money ####   one of the best laptops i had used  ## it is beautiful in every way i bought on friends advice but after working for two days love it ####   I was looking for a light weight laptop with small touch screen so that I can use it like a tab this is the only laptop matching my requirements under my budget (<80k). ####   The stylus is not working fake stylus ####   Everything is perfect when it comes to the product. Go for it blindly. But price keep fluctuating for this product. I paid around 80k ##  within days its about 77k. It could go down as low as 73k with bank discount offers during festive seasons. I feel cheated by the seller for this high price hence only four star. Buy only when you get good discount offers. Don't be impatient like me. ####   I recently purchased this laptop from Croma during the annual fest after thorough research and I must say that I wasted time in researching and getting confused. ####    Best laptop for students and professionals as well . The HP Envy x360 13 is an excellent small two-in-one with a higher-end design than you'd typically get at this price -- assuming you can find one in stock. Factor in the solid AMD performance and battery life and it's an easy recommendation .and taking about processor (b/w ENVY and PAVILION) ####   Extremely happy with the purchase as the laptop is very light and fast. Except camera which is average everything else is just too amazing. ####   Great ####   Great light convertible. Thin and easy to use. Big illuminated keys. Fast and easy on the eyes with adjusted brightness. Enjoying the experience ####   Very Good Product ####   Nice lapy... ####   TL;DR - ####   This laptop I have been using for more than a month now and I am fully satisfied with the performance. Its really fast while booting up and has a really nice keyboard and is light and portable. ####   I had always wanted to get myself a high processing and high utility laptop ##  and this was my first big purchase ever. ####   Value for money...can be used as a tablet or Pad ##  the pen is marvelous ####   A great laptop for scientific research programmes and simulations. Fast start and excellent processing speed. great sound and excellent graphics. good value for money. ####   PROs: ####   Love this laptop jst close ur eyes and go for it 😍 awesome features and look is also so premium"},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictus by HP Ryzen 5 5600H 16.1-inch(40.9 cm) FHD Gaming Laptop (8GB RAM/512GB SSD/4GB RTX 3050 Graphics/Flicker Free Display/Windows 10/MS Office/Mica Silver/2.48 Kg) ##  16-e0076AX ##  Black\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹85 ## 215.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹15 ## 225.00 (18%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Processor: 5th Gen AMD Ryzen 5 5600H (3.3GHz base clock speed ##  up to 4.2 GHz Max Boost Clock ##  16MB L3 cache ##  6 core ##  12 threads) # Memory & Storage: 8 GB DDR4-3200 MHz RAM ##  Up to 32 GB DDR4-3200 SDRAM (2 x 16 GB) | Storage: 512 GB PCIe NVMe TLC M.2 SSD # Display: 40.9 cm (16.1\") diagonal ##  FHD (1920 x 1080) ##  60 Hz Refresh Rate ##  IPS ##  edge-to-edge ##  micro-edge ##  250 nits ##  137 ppi ##  Color Gamut: 45% NTSC # Graphics & Networking: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 (4 GB GDDR6 dedicated) | Realtek Wi-Fi 6 (2x2) and Bluetooth 5.2 combo (Supporting Gigabit data rate) ##  MU-MIMO supported ##  Miracast Compatible # Operating System & Software: Pre-loaded Windows 10 Home with lifetime validity ## Free upgrade to Windows 11* when available(Refer Microsoft Website) | Pre-installed Microsoft Office Home & Student 2019 | Alexa Built-in##", "no_of_rating": "181 ratings", "avg_rating": "4.3", "total_no_answer": "\n453 answered questions\n", "delivery_type": "FREE delivery:", "delivery_date": "EMI", "Model": "16-e0076AX", "Brand": "HP", "SpecificUses": "Gaming", "ScreenSize": "16.1 Inches", "OS": "Windows 10 Home", "more_detail": "\nBrand\n#\n‎HP\n\n\nManufacturer\n#\n‎HP Inc., HP India Sales Pvt.

Anad i am using the laptop for just photoshop and premiere pro and this laptop stoped working in an instant and after that the display is completely gone now i cant even tell how much disappointed😞 i am... Please apario give aproper sevice ####   Guys I'm posting this review after one month of use since I have invested 75k in it. ####   Nothing is good in this laptop ....I bought and I disposing ....if anyone from hp ... provide me refund or replacement of this laptop..now see after they open laptop and check what issue ...now it's start heating .... keyboard area so much hot now say what to do.... please replace this and give or give me refund ...other many good laptop available in market ####    It's totally awesome👏 ####   I bought it for my son ##  he's a B.Arch student ##  after one week one of the keyboard button Stop working ##  we've raised the issue with HP but no response after a week. Overall my son is happy with the system. ####   Thermals:- ####   I looked up every single laptop for this configuration ##  but at last I ended on this. ####   Performance is better and battery life during my usage is ####   Never seen before laptop like that it's very very great ##  I love this laptop ##  gaming also cool and battry is so good. One more thing price is great . Thanks Amazon thanks hp victus ####   Cons: 60hz refresh rate ####    Hmm intersting laptop... Good thermals ##  good battery life for a gaming laptop ##  good speakers ##  good Matt finish screen but laptop is a bit heavy and most importantly screen wobble is too much ##  I mean way too much ####   A one-liner review must be something like \"Value for money laptop with worthy hardware specifications and average build quality\". ####   Its good product with maximum features in less amount compared to dell and other brands. ####   Guys don't worry the build quality ##  It's very well built with use of very good plastics. ####   Rtx 3050 not upto the mark ## while gaming you can use the advantage of DLSS.Ray tracing ..... Just forget. ####   Dislike ####   This laptop is a beast .. without any doubt you can buy this lap .. check my utube channel for review ..  channel name : Navz gaming world ####   I like the product performance. It's superfast!! ####   HP Victus is built awesomely. Except being on wrong side for weight there is nothing else you will hardly won't like about this laptop. If you are looking for a personal all rounder go for it. ####   Good product ####   Keyboard is  very tactile ##  touchpad is huge like MacBook's and  XPS's build quality feels solid in my hand compared to my old Dell Inspiron 3567 speakers are loud enough loud enough for watching YouTube and Netflix and prime. Overall I'm really happy with my purchase 10/10 ####   Vey nice laptop and thermals are good too I play gta v at very high setting noag and temp doesn't get above 80 ####   I am writing this review after using the laptop for 2+ weeks after receiving the laptop. ####   Value for money ##  thermals are not that great. ####   Its the best gaming laptop under 75k. Battery life is also good. ####   The delivery was spot on as promised. Packaging and delivery no issues. To get it started was a breeze. No need for any external paid assistance. The only major issue that is noticed is the screen shaking a bit when opened and needs extra care if handling. Overall I recommend this one. ####   The wobbling of screen is very high and can damage the screen. How is this possible that the technical team did not notice this. ####   Pros ####   ** Please read the complete review before making any decisions ####   Don't know my piece is faulty or not but I updated windows and bios ##  nvidia drivers ##  amd drivers. ####   Best for the 🪲 ####   This is a decent looking laptop with high performance ##  GTA V runs so smooth on RTX 3050. Close your eyes and buy this. ####   I don't like the screen wobble in this laptop and the screen is dim .these are the defects and afterall the laptop is perfect ####   I have been using this laptop from last one week.. ####   HP Victus is amazing.. but i would mention some points to clear your confusion ####   One of the best laptops under ₹75000. You guys already know the specs. So i'm not covering that topic. ####    Is this screen bleeding issue? Can someone confirm? Is this normal? Should i return this product? ####   I don't liked the buils quality it's looking cheap. ####   It's good ####   It's a perfect entry level gaming laptop with the latest rtx graphics. The build quality is average but its what expected at this price point. Honestly The display  is much better than what i expected and has very good brightness and the anti glare performance is pretty good overall. Speakers are loud enough and the quality is quite fine ##  the keyboard feels quite average but again the pricing justifies it. The ssd performance is also quite good and the ryzen 5 chipset just seals the deal for me. ####   Battery life awesome ##  and temps are also fine  ##  but there is no battery charge limit option ##  which is kinda concerned while playing gaming when plugged in ##  it will decreases the battery life span ##  Please add that option in future updates ####    Hi Samurai! ####   The only issue is disply wobble and colour accuracy apart from these this is the best laptop in this price range ####   First off ##  the price to performance ratio on this thing is just amazing. The display ##  the contrast ratio on the display is too good to be true on an IPS panel. Keyboard feels good ##  adequately placed keys. ####   Damn ##  this Wobble.....Can't say its not noticeable ##  buy only if you are okay with your screen syncing with your fan. ####   Just spent a day with Victus. The wobble is surprisingly less and the build feels quite good. Will test a few days for thermals and battery life. For now ##  this looks like an amazing deal! ####   Screen wobble issue is there when ceiling full is in it's full speed ####   The laptop performance is great and smooth. ####   Looks: Awesome ####   A mixed bag. But truly a beast within this beauty if you go by specs alone. This machine has technical capabilities ##  its the execution that makes you want a bit more quality. ####   Overall you have everything in this laptop. ####   I've been using it for sometime now and here are my thoughts ####   Good laptop but problem of screen bleeding other all things are fine ####   1) unexpected 'kernel power 41 error' power loss ####   Been using it for a couple of hours tested couple of games like rise of the tomb raider on high settings TBH i am quite satisfied with the performance will let you guys update soon the build quality is not bad don't be scared. And there is a slight wobble when air hits the chassis from the back but it's quite bearable just go for it .. ####   Booking.com ##  express vpn  ##  Dropbox ##  Macafee  was pre-installed and unable to uninstall express vpn. ####    Great laptop at this cost. All the specs justify the price and are suitable for all purposes such as gaming ##  video editing ##  graphics designing etc. ####    The outlook seems to good  but as the finish is kind of matte finger prints are smudged in the outer cases and the display hinge is built with less quality. It's wobbling with air from the fan . Charging seems to be faster with the 200w charger and all the required ports are provided in the lap. Need to test the laptop with multi tasking and gaming to provide detailed review on the performance. Display resolution is good with 60 hz when comparing other laptops. Speakers are not providing very good sound experience but sound quality is ok. ####   Look is premium ##  Body is sturdy ##  hard plastic ##  display is good.  Battery life is good ##  using since last 3.5 hr and still 55% battery remaining. lightning fast speed ##  keyboard is good. No fan noise on normal day to day work but if you want to play games small fan noise is there. overall value for money. ####   Received it on Aug 6th ####   The Rtx 3050 is giving more performance than I thought ##  its thermals are good (45°C normal use and max use while gaming and editing stuf it has 89°- 90° max temperatures ) ##  build quality is also good the uper body does not flex that much and have good quality plastic build. don't think twice ##  just go for it !"},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP Pavilion Gaming 15.6-inch(39.62 cms) FHD Gaming Laptop (Ryzen 5-4600H/8GB/1TB HDD/M.2 Slot/Windows 10/NVIDIA GTX 1650 4GB/Shadow Black) ##  15-ec1024AX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹70 ## 172.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹16 ## 182.00 (23%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 4600H (3.0 GHz base clock ##  up to 4.0 GHz max boost clock ##  3 MB L2 cache ##  6 cores) # Display: 15.6-Inch FHD IPS anti-glare micro-edge WLED-backlit ##  250 nits ##  45% NTSC (1920 x 1080) # Operating System: Pre-loaded Windows 10 Home with lifetime validity # Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 (4 GB GDDR6 dedicated)##", "no_of_rating": "580 ratings", "avg_rating": "4.0", "total_no_answer": "\n301 answered questions\n", "delivery_type": "FREE delivery:", "delivery_date": "EMI", "Model": "Pavilion Gaming", "Brand": "HP", "SpecificUses": "Personal, gaming, business", "ScreenSize": "15.6 Inches", "OS": "Windows 10 Home", "more_detail": "\nBrand\n#\n‎HP\n\n\nManufacturer\n#\n‎hp, Manufactured by one of the following: 1.

The laptop takes time to boot and open some applications because of the little slow HDD. You just need to buy an SSD and copy the OS init ##  that will make it ROCKET ####   Good for gaming ##  great for surfing and stable with battery. Looks sturdy and well built. Amazing design. Panel is accurate as described.. Overall! no dissapointment. Hp delivers again! ####   I can't do multiple actions ##  even single click  I must wait while ##  I went to hp care they said hard disk was damged  ##  amezon delivered a damged piece to me ####   Very fast and snappy but battery life could be better ####   Best products at best rice ####   Hello sir I want this ...... Produce as free simple  HP Pavilion Gaming 15.6-inch(39.62 cms) FHD Gaming Laptop (Ryzen 5-4600H/8GB/1TB HDD/M.2 Slot/Windows 10/NVIDIA GTX 1650 4GB/Shadow Black) ##  15-ec1024AX.  Thank you ####   I usually don't write reviews unless I find a product exceptionally wonderful ##  or extremely terrible. This was a mixed product. ####   Don't buy without SSD... ####   They have Advertised Game +Business in and Microsoft free ##  so not stand on there words... Regards Laptop is too slow ##  but they have mentioned in add they are giving me Microsoft Office to but now its demo version... Gaming is too slow... I think go for other model instead of this... ####    Good ####   Plz go for SSD and higher RAM ####   Just go for it if your budget is below 50k else try to get the varient having 144hz display with SSD drive. ####   Worst product ####   I had bought the laptop on 25th June ##  there was a hard disk failure and the Mother board failure  ##  this laptop is a failed version ####   I got the product and happily unbox it then when i turned on the laptop for the first time ##  I found this laptop was already logged in by someone named Ashok Chopra with login pin. Now I cannot login nor use this laptop.Worst unboxing feeling ever. ####   Very slow laptop.. complete waste of money. ####   So First of all thanks to @gamingsetupdeals.Search in telegram Gaming Setup deals and offers and just join this channel for best offers on laptops . ####   Don't but this for gaming ####   Adding SSD is must without SSD it's take 5-10 min to be usable overall good laptop... ####   The product is really good.Boot up speed is slow  ## so go for ssd variant. ####   Worest product very slow ####   At first ##  there was screen bleeding on the screen ##  i exchanged the laptop and the another one i got was looking second hand ##  and on the box ##  there was also many stickers placed.. when i opened it ##  the laptop was broken from the charging point.. i am very disappointed ####   An excellent product with really good features ##  the screen clarity is really nice ##  really good processor speed and a decent battery as well. ####   Good battery life ####   Speed feel very slow compare to SSD. ####   कस्टमर केयर का बात करने का तरीका सही नहीं हैं ####   Everything is wrong  in this laptop . this is painfully slow in everything  . ####   I PURCHASE THIS LAPTOP ON 26-07-21 AND GET BY 28-07-2021 ##  WITH WINDOWS 10 AND OFFICE PREINSTALLED ##  BUT I WAS UNABLE TO INSTALL LATEST PRINTER CANON MF241D. WHEN I OPEN 5-6 TABS IN CHROME  ##  TABS GETTING CRASHED AND SHOWING MASSEGE NOT ENOGH RESOURCES TO PROCESS ##  I GET VERY UPSET TO PURCHASE THIS HIGH END LAPTOP FOR 60K. VERY OVERPRICED FOR ITS PERFORMANCE. I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE . ####   Its almost a year since I am using this laptop. The build quality of this laptop is very poor. After 1 year of use ##  white spots started appearing on the display. ####   For students it may be not the best laptop ####   Worth for price ####   The specs this laptop offers is easy for running any of the latest AAA open world ##  massive multiplayer game lobbies with a steady smooth fps on relatively satisfactory visual quality. ####   It's not that good for gaming but overall it's good battery life is good we can run all type of software good for students and we can do gaming but not on much high level. ####   For gaming it's tough 🔥 ####   Nice as of now. ####   Great product ####   Fine ####   Writing a review after 1.5 months ##  purchased the laptop from HP Store ####   HP Pavilion Gaming laptop performance is very good  ## But sometimes while playing games & while using some other applications system is taking time to open for compare others laptop this is little bit slow ####   Without ssd storage is lags like dos computers from 20th century. Videos hang. Scrolling hang. Without even having any major applications on. ####   It is very slow due lack of ssd so recommend you buy a veriant with ssd it is very very slow ####   On papers the performance looks batter but in reality its slow ####   Recieved damaged product still processing for return but technician not came ####   Use SSD to run the unit. SSD for fast performance . ####   Cons ####   While I was playing World of Warships ##  the FPS rose to just 61 ##  despite having 4GB graphics. When I first played on the laptop ##  with the Integrated Radeon Graphics ##  the FPS rose to a whopping 75! But later ##  i discovered that you cant play in Radeon Graphics when the laptop is charging ##  as the FPS drops to 15 when you do so. So I had to switch to the NVIDIA dedicated graphics. It was much better as I could now play while charging. But the FPS got limited to 61. Expected higher gaming performances. But overall ##  it's performance is quite satisfactory. ####   Bought the laptop in Jan. ####   other than battery everything is awesome ####   Multipurpose usage with decent look ##  nothing too flashy like RGB light and all. ####   You can buy this. One of the best in the price segment. Bought for 59990. And added a ssd 512 gb for 6k. Total 66k worth ####   My laptop having lots of problem after I login pu password it is coming a black scree with cursor I hate this thing ####   Camera quality very poor quality and System is very slow Dragging ####    I have not done or use in gaming becoz it takes bootes time i.e 30 minutes ####   Although its come with a powerful processer and a high level grafix card but its running slow some time and also it's battery backup is almost 3..4 hour . And its a good choice. ####   Speakers make a crackling sound ####   SSD upgrade is must..to run Windows faster !! ####   Worst laptop performance ever. After a year of usage it gives u soo embarrassing movements ever. It doesn’t works as it seems to. It stucks so much not worth buying. ####   **packaging was terrible ##  a large open( broken seal ##  wide open ) cardboard box appeared ##  the laptop was rattling at the bottom ##  no buble wrap or airbag cushioning. ####   Good ####   Just add a ssd to it and it will will in its best proformance or else if u not do so it will lag sometimes becoz the hard disk cant take the load of this powerfull procwssor ####   Not so worthy ####   Worst laptop  ##  takes ages to start ##  pathetic product ####   This a good product in all accounts except for the disk acces slowing it down. There are a few windows settings you can tweak to work around it but best is to invest in an SSD for it. Outside of that the display ##  keyboard and all around elegance are amazing. It comes across as surprisingly light for a laptop in this range. Great value for money overall even if you spend a bit more for the SSD later on. ####   Worst laptop.always hang ####   Worth it I'm upgraded ssd and ram performance good in this price ####   slowing down after 2months of use ####   Good ####   Hi ##  so this is a review after a month long usage ##  and the game played was GTA 5. The laptop build quality and its looks are awesome. It's genuinely a beautiful laptop ##  and comes with Win 10 home pre-installed. I would recommend don't go for set-up service ##  as it's overcharged ##  you just have to enter your microsoft email id or gmail id n u r good to go. ####   It’s a good product but battery life should be more ####   The startup time is terribly terrible. Avarage is more than 5 min. Feels like living in an age of 90's! Not at all recommended to invest your money. Not sure how the SSD version will perform. But didn't expect the HDD version to be so pathetic. ####   At first week i have faced some issues with Laptop keyboard  ## F5 key is smugged inside  ##  i have reseted it . ####   I purchased this laptop 1 month ago ##  and it is performing good ##  the processor is excellent. Ryzen 4600h easily outperforms 9th gen Intel core i5 and even older i7 processor. However the HDD is too slow ##  it is bottleneck in whole laptop ##  so you must have to purchase an SSD. I also installed Samsung 970 evo plus 500 gb and 8GB crucial 3200 Mhz Ram ##  and now it have became beast in terms of performance. Overall a very good laptop ##  display is excellent ##  although speakers are little bit less loud but sound quality is good. ####   good ####   Value for money product ####   Battery good ####   Looks its out of Stock on AMZ ## but good product. ####   Laptop is great. It's plastic body use to get dirty(fingerprints impression) is the only problem I saw ####   Build quality is good ##  but feels slow while working...and battery backup is half as claimed by the company. ####   I've been using this laptop for more than a month now.. I primarily use it for video editing and gaming.. ####   Looks good but body is of plastic ##  Should be counting HDD 7200rpm according to the discrimination but no it contains 5400rpm disk. ####   After 2 weeks of usage. ####   Good gaming laptop ####   its my first day with the laptop and i found 2 major defects - ####   It's looks better than the Pic... Handy Laptop... 😊 ####   Works really smoothly ####   A very nice laptop. The camera quality is matchless! Very edgy design. Happy with the purchase. ####   Very good laptop at this price.... ####    It's a sexy machine with enough horsepower to run any demanding game you're gonna throw at it for the next few years. The looks man! Many complaining it doesn't look premium. Idk about them ##  the matte black finish ##  sharp square edges ##  speaker grills- everything screams sexy. I haven't played any games yet ##  will update soon. GTA V is being downloaded. Connectivity seems great since Im using the max speeds of my broadband without any hiccup. Speakers are loud enough ##  and they're crisp! Yes it only has a hdd ##  but I bought a ssd the wd green for just 2.5k. at that price it's the best you'll get! Display is fine af. Beautiful punchy colour ##  nice contrast everything you need. TL;DR - Go for it blindly!!"},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDell 14 (2021) i3-1125G4 2in1 Touch Screen Laptop ##  8Gb RAM ##  256Gb SSD ##  14” (35.56 cms) FHD Display ##  Win 10 + MSO ##  Backlit KB + FPR ##  Silver Color (Inspiron 5410 ##  D560563WIN9S)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹69 ## 695.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹19 ## 705.00 (28%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available.

Nice product and easy to carry. Great sound quality. ####   Touch pad button is loose. When I contacted Dell they replied this is working as per design. Think twice before buying this item. ####   I bought this laptop 2 days back. But I am having heating issues within 15 mins. Is it normal with this model. ####    Poor service and product ####   Using it for less than a week but initial feedback  is that it looks good so far. Good packaging . Sleek and  slim; setting it up and registering it was a breeze. Configuration and accessories as per specification.

This laptop keeps freezing in between. ####   I bought laptop for my sister for her study purpose and that's why I went for a budget laptop by asus. ####   I have spent on anti virus  ##  SSD and LAN adaptor for this ASUS laptop but functionality seems poor. ####   This is an average laptop where by spending a bit more you can convert this into splendid one. Upgrade the ram to 8 gb and addition of extra 256 SSD. ####   At starting for the first time itself is hanging like crazy. All apps crashing. The laptop has NO volume ##  even on 100 I've to stick ear near speaker to understand. It's a very slow laptop ##  rather you buy something with SSD ####   I ordered this laptop once ##  it was lagging so I replaced it when I  received replaced product it was having same issues. I suggest plz avoid buying it and save you money ####   Nice laptop ##  good battery Ok for normal work ##  light gaming can do internet surfing and more. ####   This product is good but there is one mistake in it is it's battery is not quite good ####   *Important*: Uninstall McAfee antivirus as soon as possible. It slows down the laptop a lot. Also finish all updates from Microsoft. ####   sound and webcam quality is horrible. try to choose ssd version for nice performance. average product but kinda disspointed with audio quality ####   Laptop is good but battery life is very bad ####   One of the  best laptop in this price range ##  ####   Its very slow ##  don't waste your money but if you want baddest experience of your life only in that case you should go we this laptop ####   0.) Camera Quality is Very Bad. ####   It keeps freezing ####   It is a good laptop in this price range .laptop is little bit slow because it has only HDD.in this laptop ssd slot is available .overall laptop is good after using it for 1 week. ####   Not for good gaming but i love it on everything ####   This laptop definitely need an m.2 nvme ssd to get that snappiness you will not like its performance with pre installed hard drive. Webcam is beloew average in this segment ##  screen quality and build quality is good. Overall you can consider this laptop but with an ssd upgrade. ####   This is budget laptop so there isn’t point talking about gaming. Laptop comes with 64bit windows 10 preinstalled for which 4GB ram isn’t enough . Either install one more 4 GB ram or else use 32 bit because only downside of this system is RAM idle windows 10 takes like 70% . Like every one already commented ##  remove macaffe antivirus completely ##  it slows the system a lot . Ryzen 3 is good enough for browsing ##  MS office  ##  VC etc... power back up is really good. Finger print is nice addition on a budget laptop . No Ethernet port though but type C and type A 3.1 makes up for that. Overall it’s the best one this price range. ####   4gb ram is very low for this device ####   Very slow ## not reponsive. ####   Very poor quality product . ####   Not any gaming possible at all ##  very slow ##  freezes all the the time even in 2 tabs in microsoft edge. ####   Don't expect anything magical at this price point. It's an average laptop meant for average office work or study purposes. The laptop may seem laggy at the beginning ##  that's because of the pre-installed mcafee antivirus ##  just uninstall it and you should be fine. Would not suggest it for gaming. ####   BOOTING VERY  SLOW  BROWSER  SPEED LIKE OLD CELERON SYSTEM EVERY TIME NEED UPDATES TOTALY WASTE OF TIME I THINK MY OLD HP COMPAG IS BETTER THAN  THIS ASUS LAPTOP ####   Don't purchase any asus product however it offers at no cost I purchased i3 4gb 1tb and no resolution found for my issue they replied I have to pay extra charge ####   Laptop is really good 👍 very light weight ####   The Laptop keeps on freezing whenever your using it. How can ##  I resolve the problem? ####   Camera not working. Difficult to reach tech support. Customer hotline non responsive after holding for 10 minutes. Still in warranty but no use if one cant go through. ####   Everything is good except sound. ####   Over all good ..Value for money ####   Serves it purpose. Th screen is a bit dim though.. ####   I think it will be more helpful if this product has 8gb of memory ####   Laptop is very good in terms of design and looks. Screen is of decent quality ##  sound is very less. Good for medium works. Overall it's it's very good budget laptop..! ####   From day 1 itself Microphone jack is not working 😭 ####   You can and on it after ram and storage upgradation but don't recommend to game on it ####   It’s good ##  not bad at all ##  Quality has been maintained ##  but sometimes the laptop automatically freezes ##  do not know if it’s the windows or the Ryzen processor. Battery is decent ##  could have been better ##  camera is average. ####   Its awesome for study purpose and office use ####   Product offers value for this price range however I am disappointed with the display quality. It is below average in terms of clarity ####   Laptop is good for home use.  SSD ##  as expected makes a big difference to the speed. Not much bloatware.  Performance is great for home use. Office2019 works well.  No heating issues so far.  Laptop does have a good battery life atleast to last 4-5 hours with good use. ####   Lap is worth for 30 k rs most of the features are available but camera is very poor ####   Processor is not upto the mark... otherwise fantastic product... Keyboard is just awesome ####   It is worth the value. ####   Poor volume ##  to hear anything we need some external speakers. ####   Updated : 30 April 2021 ####   #Design: 5/5... Nice build quality without metal body ##  doesn't feel cheap ##  keypad is at bottom with couple of mm from the surface in this new M415DA series ##  apart from M409DA. ####   Very slow and it heats up too... Amazon service not willing to acknowledge this as a problem. ####   Very Nice! ####   Overall a good product in good price. ####   this laptop avrage camera quality bad and speaker sound low and display side angle colour blur. and battery 3hours working normal uses and design good performance good boot time is also good ####   1 ) Uninstalled HDD kit. ####   It's a laptop with all the things included to help the laptop run smoothly. ####   Very good product from Asus at this price range.... SSD is lightening fast.... Screen could have been better.... Sound is awesome.... Batter life is also good.... Overall it's a really nice laptop for working professionals and students.... ####   It is a nice and a quick laptop in starting days it should work in future as it works now .but power button should be given seperatly sound should be more better than now overall all good thanks ASUS perfect laptop ####   Good product ####   Everything thing is fine but camera quality is poor because of vga cam ####   Works super cool ####   Product is very nice....very gud purchase in this price 👌 ####   Build quality and performance is good.. Ram/ssd upgrades are possible. 4 gb wasn't enough. I added a g.skill ripjawss 4gb additionally. Now it's very good and meets my basic needs. ####   I dont know whether my device is faulty or not ##  but I am observinf a weird issue right from the first day of usage. When I turn on the laptop everything is fine. Then if I close the screen lid and open it again after sometime the display becomes yellowish(like the night mode) ##  but night mode stays off. If i restart the laptop ##  then everything becomes fine again. I hope this issue gets fixed by future software updates."},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDell Inspiron 3501 15.6\" FHD Display Laptop (i5-1135G7 / 8GB / 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD / Integrated Graphics / Win10 + MSO / Backlit KB / Soft Mint Color) D560559WIN9S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹75 ## 011.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹15 ## 721.00 (21%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": "₹59 ## 290.00", "about": "#Processor:11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 Processor (8MB Cache ##  up to 4.2 GHz) # Memory & Storage:8GB ##  8Gx1 ##  DDR4 ##  2666MHz | 256GB M.2 PCIe NVMe Solid State Drive (Boot) + 1TB 5400 rpm 2.5\" SATA Hard Drive (Storage) # Display:15.6-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) Anti-glare LED Narrow Border WVA Display # Graphics:Intel Iris Xe Graphics with shared graphics memory # Operating System & Software:Windows 10 Home Single Language | Microsoft Office Home and Student 2019 # I/O ports:USB 3.2 Gen 1 (x2) ##  USB2.0 (x1) ##  HDMI 1.4(x1) ## One SD-card slot  ## RJ45 - 10/100Mbps##", "no_of_rating": "48 ratings", "avg_rating": "4.0", "total_no_answer": "\n22 answered questions\n", "delivery_type": "Details", "delivery_date": "FREE Delivery", "Model": "Inspiron 3501", "Brand": "Dell", "SpecificUses": "Personal", "ScreenSize": "15.6", "OS": "Windows 10", "more_detail": "\nBrand\n#\n‎Dell\n\n\nManufacturer\n#\n‎Dell India Pvt Ltd, Dell international Pvt Ltd\n\n\nModel\n#\n‎Inspiron 3501\n\n\nModel Name\n#\n‎Inspiron 3501\n\n\nModel Year\n#\n‎2021\n\n\nProduct Dimensions\n#\n‎36.4 x 24.9 x 2 cm; 1.8 Kilograms\n\n\nBatteries\n#\n‎1 Lithium ion batteries required.

After some month it become very slow ##  it is take 10 - 15 to start. ####   Good quality value for money laptop ####   Excellent ####   Capacity of the RAM and the picture clarity is superb. ####   After using 5 months . I feel need to improve battery and performance. to this product. ####   Very disappointed ☹️☹️ ####   Laptop not working properly ####   Super Lenovo Model and Amazon is always best ####   Very good and good quality 👍 ####   I wish the laptop was send with a good bag along with it ##  so that one would have such accessories befitting the item purchased. ####   Useless product ##  very low processing even in light work ##  heat instantly hang evey time. ####   Screen hang and take more time during first login ####   Good in all aasoects ####   Battery life very poor and don't buy this laptop ####   Brought this Laptop at 34 ## 999/- Which is a Great Deal !! Best Laptop for Office Purpose with 8 GB (DDR4) Ram!! ####   Battery Life - not more than 2 hrs ####   After 3 months the mic problem ####    To much slow and hang 1.20 ghz proccessor its poor .What should i do now. Can i replace it i buyed 1 mont before ####   This should be the best deal I would have got at this price range. My need is connection to office network ##  internet surfing and basic domestic operations. The laptop is a perfect choice. ####   Value for money. ####   Product is defected. Extremely disappointed. Keyboard is defected. ####   Though battery life is less the performance is very good ####   Its very nice the laptop is so slim and good ####   After 2 months of buy battery not charging more than 59%?? ####   Very nice and as per expectation. ####   Happy with the product performance ####   Value for money is fine ####   Good laptop but the camera is worst please give 720p webcam also with this laptop battery life is good 3hour overall best for business use ####   Laptop is slim & stylish ####   Don't expect to do any gaming besides card games. But if you're using it for productivity purposes like MS Office ##  OpenOffice etc ##  this is all you need. Don't buy this if you're doing heavy video editing or graphics-heavy work. Battery capacity is disappointing especially these days when most laptops can do a minimum of 6 hours. You'll be lucky to get 4 hours of backup time on this one. Maybe a little more if you reduce the brightness of the screen. Overall it is a decent machine for the price. ####   After one month of use ##  screen flickering and can not use. I feel its waste of money. Be careful befor buy this product ####   Does not come with pre-installed windows ####   The worst lap i have ever used ####   Do not purse I faced many issues. Waste of money. No refund bad lenovo service. Buy Dell or Acer. Lenovo cheats customers giving default products. I purchased one on 1 September hardly used and it stopped working. I didn't get replacement for it. Slow process battery life very bad hangs up. ####   Good product ####   The  camera stopped working after 5 days of use. ####   Amazing product in the price range . I loved it ####   It am honest it's the best I have buyen 2 laptops ####   Good ####   Battery draining very quickly and very very slowly getting signal... ####   So far good. ####   Very bad battery life and heating problem. Very slow. 8 gb ram always showing is used by laptop and it makes slow the process. ####   Good product ####   Absolute trash. And the service is worse. Bought this in urgency for the kid’s exams. It stopped working in one week! It’s been more than two weeks now that it has been with the service Center and apparently the mother board has had to be replaced ##  the key board is replaced and the hinge joining the screen is to be replaced. What the the hell did Lenovo sell me? A piece of trash?? And the service Center people don’t respond ##  don’t pick calls ##  have no clue as to what is happening or when we can expect it back. An absolute waste of my money ####   Battery life very poor.MS office not installed. ####   A good budget laptop. The battery life is okay but not satisfied. Worth for money... ####   Good ####   We bought this laptop one month before and now facing problems as shown in the picture...while using the system immediately the message will come like this. This is happening every day. ####   Don't go for this.... Battery life is very very very poor... Camera quality is also very... This product is care of address for worthless and useless ####   Goof ####   I like this product and value for money ####   Value for money.  Good to have separate buttons for PgUP down etc.  They are on the Num Pad. Numpad as such wasn't necessary in my view. ####   Nice product"},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP Pavilion 11th Gen Intel Core i5 Processor 14 inches FHD Laptop with Alexa Built-in (16GB/512GB SSD/Windows 10/MS Office/2GB NVIDIA MX450 Graphics/Natural Silver/1.41 Kg) ##  14-dv0084TX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹78 ## 293.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹6 ## 803.00 (9%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available* Disclaimer-*The Windows 11 upgrade will be delivered late 2021 into 2022.

Logged a case with HP support and followed up more than twenty times at each point of contact and till date haven't received the quotation as they say it's physical damage and not covered under warranty. Whereas when I raised the issue there were no signs of physical damage. ####   Its ultra fast and its light weight. As a developer ##  I think I got what I need. ####   1 tb ssd + i7 + 16gb ram + backlit keyboard + fingerprint sensor ####   HD screen is super cool. Haven't seen any cons as of now ####    Laptop is good ##  quality product ##  just stopped working after 4 days when I needed this laptop the most. ####   Probably the worst ever laptop from hp. It's my humble request to kindly do not purchase this laptop. It started malfunctioning within a month of purchase plus Amazon isn't really helpful in dealing with such issues. ####   I replaced my 7 years old HP 15 A series laptop with i5 and 12 GB (extended RAM) + AMD Graphics card + Dual OS with this one. ####   The brand new laptop was not of the quality . The usb port is defective ####   Very good performance… ####   Liked the configurations ##   not the laptop  ##  looks good but still has a long way to go to even beat macbook air. ####   My friend baught it in 84K ##  i7 . There is 20k difference. Plus you will get a premium quality mouse and a bag. ####   Laptop USB slot damaged. I could not insert flash drive into it. ####   Nice product & and everything is perfect 🥰 ####   It's a good laptop within the price range. ####   Nice laptop for productivity ####   Processer speed given 2.8ghz but as per product it should come up with 4.5ghz. while doing multitask some times getting stuck . ####   It's gud ####   If you are student have a lot of excel modelling to do ##  multi-task to do GO FOR IT. ####   All the great features and performance of this laptop become useless with very frequent abrupt shutting down problem. I have invested quite a few hours researching online solutinand chatting with executives on HP ##  the problem remains rendering it a useless machine since I can’t face shutdown4-5 times a day during important Zoom meetings ####   The product has good specifications. Although the price appeared a bit high (85k) ##  the features are worth going for. Superfast usage because of processor and RAM. Camera quality is not great. In addition ##  the screen cannot be tilted/folded much. ####   ******* Don't buy this product ******** ####   No heating issues ##  good battery life ##  and smooth performance. Have been using it for almost a month now. ####   Value for money ####   its nice look and super . ####   Processor range is not matching as mentioned in Amazon ####   Laptop with great config and looks. Only think I felt HP should have given with this is Laptop Bag along with the laptop. ####   Awesome ####   An amazing product except that it has an overheating problem and shuts down automatically. Other than that it is great! ####   RED LINE across the screen. Never buy HP - what was more disappointing was that Amazon didn't help in this regard ####    Opened the package late as I was busy and didn’t think a brand like hp would have defects…BOY WAS I WRONG!! straight out of the box the keyboard has an issue. How do I return this now? ####   It's not even a month I bought this new laptop & am facing laptop shutdown issues frequently & on restart it don't save session before shutdown & I loose all work....on Googling I find reason to be related to internal power supply issue(I don't have power outage @ home but it's has to do with internal power supply) very disappointed to see such pathetic product after paying so high amount. ####   Very thin ##  very light ##  starts quickly ##  smooth keypad ##  laptop works fast. Since now its new  ##  so not facing any heating issue for now. Only limitation is the non-availability of number keypad (since its a 13.5 inch laptop). Those who are habituated of using number keypad may find it uncomfortable a bit for sometime. But to ease that ##  one may buy external keyboard. Rest everything is awesome. ####   This happened on the third day after I bought it back ##  and the machine crashed. ####   One of the best laptops available . ####   Must buy ####   Easy to handle. Wonderful display. Boots up in 10 secs. Best for daily routine ##  OTT viewing and multitasking/working. Gamers can skip this. ####   Good quality product ####   I bought this laptop during the sale just before Indepedence day sale. I have basic perspectives. My old Asus I3 was over 4 years old and was becoming slow. Coming from IT background ##  I wanted to purchase a laptop with good RAM ##  that will help me in my academics and I wanted the laptop to be moderately lighweight having provision for basic gaming. After extensive research through Amazon ##  finally I narrowed down to this laptop becuase it also had dedicated MX450 graphics on top of Intel Iris Xe dedicated graphics. ####   Overall the laptop is reliable and comfortable and light weight. ####   Everything's upto the mark especially the battery backup (Quick charging and easily runs for 6-7 hours for heavy development works and watching movies on single charge). ####   The product arrived on time with a neat packing. Laptop look and feel are too great. I felt it is too smaller ##  may be because I was using a bigger one earlier. It is too early to tell about performance ##  but it is found to be faster. high responsiveness. Battery is draining too fast which makes me worried. I have to use and wait for more detailed review. ####   Quite light. ####   Superb at this prize.. ####   Bought this laptop after some research and comparisons. Performance is good ##  no issues at all. It is Light weight ##  easy to carry. ####   It's compact and packed. ####   From day 1 I m updating it  ##  and it's not working ####   Superfast speed ##  great looks and very light weight. Really like it. ####   I've been using the product for 3 days now. It's fast and good. ####   The laptop takes time to start. Unfortunately the exchange window closed within a week ####   Bought this laptop yesterday ##  i noticed that my display is blurry ##  anyone else noticed this? And if you managed to overcome this ##  can you please tell me how? ####   Laptop started hanging within 1 week of usage. Had to call for a techincian to help on the same ####   This project hp loptop is good then I Mac worthless but hp is good  then imac booooooooooo. Wak you imc booooo ####   I am software engineer mainly working on Citrix. Using this laptop for work. No problem with screen resolution ##  after working for 8 hours on average mode battery drops to 20% . No heating issues so far ##  amazing speakers ##  it's super fast laptop. Only camera is of low quality ##  but zoom meeting seems to give bearable experience. ####   very poor battery ##  discharges very quickly ####   Horrible Service. Makes huge Fan noise. Gets heat up at an alarming rate. Gets slow as well. ####   This laptops heats a lot from day 1 ##  settings & BIOS updates etc ##  wont work ##  fan makes noise and throws air continuously ... i replaced the laptop but in the replaced laptop also same issues even in bigger form...lot of ####   Just wished if C drive was bifurcated into 2 drives  - C and D ####   EXCELLENT ####   Fast Reboot ##  Lightweight ## Speed also very good. ####   Awesome laptop with stunning features and the assembly! 16gb with 1TB SSD rocks! ####   Excellent quality and very light weight product.alsosupporting heavy weight games .thanks to the nvidia graphics card ####   Only I got one of deffect in this laptop power button beside of delete button ##  it should be the seperate of this delete button  ## over all good ####   Laptop is really good but it is not a 4 Ghz processor it is just 2.0 GHz processor ####   The display of colours ##  clarity of images and videos was far below expected for this premium laptop if it was a manufacturing problem for the specific laptop delivered to me. USB port for Bluetooth connectivity was faulty and could not connect to the mouse bluetooth adaptor ####   1.Very fast ####   Very best product 16 gb/1 tb HP PAVILLION latest generation grey colour no fake product 101% real product.... (!!!BUT NO TOUCH SCREEN!!!) ####    Very light ##  fast and handy ##  superlook. Thanks for delivering very fast. Amazon thumbsup to you. Buy it without any second thought. ####   Windows 10 sucks like hell. Its not able to install rise of nations ##  although we through whatever amount of money at it. ####   Do go by the looks of the laptop.  Only 2 USB port and another 1 type 3 port and it seems not compatible with my current docking station. ####   It has serious overheating issues ##  when delivered first I thought may be issue with piece but when Amazon replaced with other same issue observed.. Requested for return and refund ##  will buy better laptop. ####   Battery life too less ##  ####   Intel Core i7 + 1TB SSD ####   It's able to handle extreme load of applications. ####   The laptop is not starting after a month and the service quality is very bad. I lost 85k for nothing. Amazon has very bad after sales service and I will suggest everyone to purchase from retail stores where at least they will cooperate with you ####   Cool ####   1. Its light in weight easy to carry & due to core i7 processing is fast. ####   The power adapter with hp pevilion is not working. I just used for three day and laptop is not getting charged. Don't buy this laptop. Worst product from hp. I want to replace this item. ####   Overheating problem ##  returned the product. ####   The product is working very good ####    Laptop working fine but heating a bit while using softwares like AutoCAD ##  Camtasia etc. Didn't expect this heating in i7 16GB RAM Laptop. ####   great product. only needs a couple of extra usb ports. ####   This laptop is best suitable for people with Colour blindness. All red coloured objects are displayed as orange colour. You will get no support from HP customer care other than their trial and error method & hear this as new problem ####   Speed is vey fast love this laptop alexa with this laptop is vey cool 16 gb ddr4 ram amazing and a big screen ####   Nice produced ####   Laptop generates lot of heat. ####   Did not like anything about this laptop....price ##  keyboard layout ##  hp support ##  customer is a joker.... customers are just there to generate revenue for these manufacturers... ####   I have been using this laptop for about 2 weeks now and can only say good things about it. I don't have to speak about configuration ##  that you all know is quite good. What additionally I can use is though it is not light or slim ##  but it is sleek and does not heat up while using ##  unlike other light and thin models. ####   This is an awesome product from HP. ####   Without a doubt ##  this one is a performance beast. A very well balanced laptop. Perfect for work ##  coding ##  studying and can handle some casual FPS gaming quite well. Can also handle old heavy duty AAA games but not the new ones. Very light in weight ##  very sleek ##  compact. Natural Silver is a beautiful colour so for those of of you who are at first glance not liking this because its not in black (I was in the same predicament) ##  do not worry ##  this colour is beautiful. Very good battery life as well. Voice recog and Alexa I haven't tried yet but soon I will. The inbuilt speakers for this are amazing. Bang & Olufsen have lived up to their brand. It has a boot time of about 10 seconds because of this absolute beast of a RAM and Processor. ####   I think this is the most advance notebook one can get  ## "},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 (2021) | AMD Ryzen 5 |14\" FHD IPS |Thin and Light Laptop | 4-Side Narrow Bezel (8GB/512GB SSD/Win10/MS Office 2019/Backlit KB/Fingerprint Reader/Arctic Grey/1.41Kg) ##  82KT00BXIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹71 ## 290.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹15 ## 300.00 (21%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": "₹55 ## 990.00", "about": "#Processor: 5th Gen AMD Ryzen 5 5500U | Speed: 2.1 GHz (Base) - 4.0 GHz (Max) | 6 Cores | 8MB Cache # OS: Pre-Loaded Windows 10 Home with Lifetime Validity # Pre-Installed: MS Office Home and Student 2019 # Memory and Storage: 8GB RAM DDR4 ##  Upgradable up to 12GB | 512 GB SSD # Display: 14\" FHD (1920x1080) | Brightness : 300nits | IPS Technology | 45% NTSC | Anti-Glare##", "no_of_rating": "143 ratings", "avg_rating": "4.5", "total_no_answer": "\n61 answered questions\n", "delivery_type": "Details", "delivery_date": "\n\nThursday, Oct 7\n", "Model": "IdeaPad 3", "Brand": "Lenovo", "SpecificUses": "Personal, Business", "ScreenSize": "14 Inches", "OS": "Windows 10 Home", "more_detail": "\nBrand\n#\n‎Lenovo\n\n\nManufacturer\n#\n‎Lenovo, One of the below: Hefei Bitland Information Technology Co.,Ltd - No.4088 Jiuxiu Road National Hefei economic & technology development area Hefei Anhui China LCFC（Hefei) Electronics Technology Co., Ltd. - NO.1-3188,YUNGU ROAD, HEFEI EXPORT PROCESSING ZONE.

I am totally happy with the buy. Bought for coding and lifht gaming ####   Best laptop ####   This product has the features and specifications that we generally see on a 60k laptop. ####   Only available ram is 5.76 of 8 Gb. 2 gb of ram is taken by the processor for graphics support. This is how rayzen5 5500U processor works ##  majority of ryzen U series works this way. All other is good with this laptop under budget. Battery backup is pretty good ##  camera quality is average. ####   Speaker is not good  ##  battery is also bad but all over laptop is op . I think better than hp 14 ryzen 5500u . In my first order u button is not working so I replaced laptop . ####   first of all I will tell all of you that this is the best laptop under 53k with latest chipset ryzen5 ## 5500u .I was very scared before buying this one . now I can suggest with confidence  ## everyone should go with this brand. ####   Writing this after using the laptop for two days. Everything in this is laptop is beyond wht i expected. Performance is great ##  display is very good and anti glare as well. Keyboard response is also very good. The only con is it's a bit on the heavier side. Overall I'll say for 52k it's an amazing deal. ####   Over all look and performance is good. Could have improved audio with 2.0 and bottom build quality ####   I bought this laptop today from shop i got it in 52k and this is the best laptop in this price segment ####   everything is good ##  just the camera quality is worst ####   battery life could be better. ####   Overall a good pick if one doesn’t care about camera and speakers quality. ####   I like the overall performance. Except for the sound issue sometimes speaker stops working and after restart starts working again. Not sure it's hardware issue or software. Will contact lenovo customer service and update the experience. ####   Best Laptop in 50K range ##  using it for past 15 days playing youtube in 4k and doing coding stuff and it is taking everything easily. ####   Processor is very good as compared to i3 ##  11 generation. ####   At that price it offers a great value ##  ####   Product is good but sound is slow and camera quality is also not good apart from this light weight boot speed is less than five seconds overall ##  it is worth buying in the price range of 52000 ####   All things excellent except camera quality and sound volume. Overall ##  a value for money laptop at this price point. ####   Overall excellent product..... ####   Used the laptop for a month. Good performance ##  Light weight and premium look. ####   favorite games ##  edit video ##  and more without burning out your processor. ####   It ticks all the boxes. ####    This is really bad. ####   For around 52 thousand ##  It is completely worth it when we compared to other products. ####   Good at this price ####   Best bild quality 60k ## only low volume spikar issue ##  great display quality 75k  ##  fast processor ## value for mony product ####   Update : ####   I bought this laptop one week ago.It was very nice for this price.I am extremely happy for this .light weight and its working and build quality is very very nice..thank you. Go for this laptop if you are opted for study purpose.you will never disappointed. ####   Grab it. Trust me you won't regret. If you are looking this laptop for study ##  coding ##  meetings ##  online classes ##  watching movies ##  sports n all. This is the best choice in this budget. I am not a gamer so no idea about gaming performance. ####   After 1 day use good ####   Good fast laptop at a reasonable price. The features provided are mostly found on a grade higher laptops. Key board backlight ##  finger print sensor ##  300 nits bright screen antiglare with win 10 and office pre installed. ####   BEST BUDGET FRIENDLY LAPTOP WITH RAYZEN 5 5500 PROCCESSOR. ####    The build quality of the laptop seems good ##  it's sturdy in hands and the hinges seem good when opening and closing. ####   Performance is excellent. Everything is smooth and fast ( I don't know about gaming experience as I don't play ). keyboard typing experience is good .it also has backlight keyboard with 2 different brightness settings for dark situations. Display is fullhd anti glare display with good brightness. Watching prime ####   Some cons: ####   I recently purchased this product from Amzon. But I received damaged display. I thought initially that it's a driver issue but later lenovo support team confirmed that display has been internally damaged. This is the 2nd time ##  I have received damaged product from same vendor. I will highly recommend to cross check everything at the first place when unboxing. ####   In this laptop speaker sound is low ##  below from average... ####   Awesome laptop.. it's responding very fast.. one problem I am facing is with warranty..I ordered the laptop on 27/June ##  but the warrenty started on 16/June.. And Amazon support says they can't do anything apart from replacement (which I don't want ##  as the laptop is currently out of stock) ####   I'm loving it ####   Go For it ##  This laptop has got more than what other laptop holds under 60k. Has an extra slot For HDD ##  RAM can be upgraded too. ####   Good laptop at reasonable price. ####   Few points after only a day of usage  ##  will update with numbers later ####    This is very initial impression after just a day of usage. I already used it for 6-8 hours. Battery backup is good. Around 4-5 hours in a single charge. The display is very good at this price range. Bezels arw so thin. The privacy shutter for the webcam will be so useful. This laptop is very lightweight at just 1.4kgs. fingerprint is as fast as a mobile device's fingerprint scanner. Chargind speed is good as well. As far as speed is concerned ##  I faced no problem. I am not gonna use it for gaming though. 2 stage backlight configuration is available. Speaker is okayish but almost all laptop are mediocre at this price range.webcam quality is okayish as well. In this price segment we cant expect more. Do visit Ozone Tech youtube channel to find unboxing videos. I ll update this review once I use the laptop enough. ####   Good Build quality ##  display(14\" ## 300nits)💻 ##  backlight keyboard ##  weight 🦋of the laptop (1.4kg) ##  all are ultimate … ####   Received product yesterday ##   1/4 of the screen has green colour..defective piece received ##  complained to Amazon waiting for return/replacement. ####   Worth every penny ####   The product is really nice ##  the color ##  keyboard ##  display and almost everything is perfect. The only complain I had was the warranty policy ##  I purchased the product(with 1year warranty policy) on 27th June but the warranty policy starts from 14th June ##  I hope that amazon solves up that problem. ####   I purchased this laptop @47k (got 5k discount on ICICI card) from Lenovo store offline. ####   Best laptop at this price range!!! ####    This is a wonderful laptop for this stunning price of 52k. As usual a very quick and neat delivery from Amazon too. ####   Best laptop under 52k . I'm very happy with the product . ####   Best in this price segment. ####   Price - I bought it for INR 51 ## 800. First of all I am not an expert in laptops. Basic stuff like processor ##  clock speed ##  RAM etc. is all I looked at before I zeroed in on this. I have not used many laptops. So my review is a standalone review on this laptop. ####   Washed out and faded colors when comparing with smartphone video quality. Specially notice in animation video. Red look Orange and white look creamy. Calibrated color using AMD Radeon setting. Still no use. ####   After 12 hours of usage I am writing this review: ####   Took a risk by buying without any reviews as it was newly launched and I'm Happy that my decision turns to be great. ####    Everything working good and also very fast response.. according to me Fully loaded laptop. Go for it if you are searching fast laptop for gaming and also professional work ####   Was hoping for 7+ GB usable RAM. Only 5.9GB usable. ####   This is small review for Potential buyers of Lenovo idea pad 3 (2021) Ryzen 5500u version 82KT00BXIN and why I chose it over HP 1030AU (5500U) - ####   UPDATE : HDD upgradability is mis-represented on official lenovo website  for 82KT00B4IN ####   Laptop is sleek in design ##  ergonomically designed keypad ##  good aesthetics.  Shutter for camera & fingerprint reader and good utilities! Initial setup and installations were breezy.  Watched India vs NZ WTC final on Hotstar in Google Chrome.  Sound was quite good & deep; didn't feel as if I was viewing it on laptop; seemed more like connected to an external Bluetooth speaker. ####   Battery 4/5 : Good battery backup. can stand 5-6 hours in one go at least. ####   It's a wonderful laptop. I got this for 52k and at that price this is insane! It has a fingerprint sensor  ##  an fhd+ anti glare display with 300 nits display  ##  ryzen 5 processor which is best in this price range. ####   Lemme make things easy for you ##  I will discuss various points to give you a full idea about this machine. ####   Everything looks really great ## the screen quality and the build is really good except the loudness of the speaker can't even hear anything ##  can't produce half the loudness created by hp14 ryzen 3 5500u ####   Awesome laptop. ####   First impressions are ⭐⭐⭐⭐ ####   Everything is great if ur budget allow you buy it without thinking twice. ####   Only it can be like."},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS VivoBook 14 (2021) ##  Intel Core i3-1115G4 11th Gen ##  14-Inch (35.56 cms) FHD Thin and Light Laptop (8GB RAM/256GB SSD/Office 2019/Windows 10/Integrated/Silver/1.6 kg) ##  X415EA-EK342TS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹51 ## 990.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹13 ## 000.00 (25%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available.

Not a hardcore gamer ##  just a guy who played games like COD ##  Project IGI ##  GTA ##  different NFS titles in college and some years after. So while replacing my years old desktop ##  thought of buying a so called \"gaming laptop\". Requirements were clear - laptop but not necessarily an ultra portable one (as mobile phone works well while on the move) ##  expandable hardware (specially RAM) ##  without any bias for AMD or Intel ##  have to be fairly latest and must be value for money. Though selected couple of others also from Lenevo and Dell; HP was most value for money of them. And 10th gen Core i5 with 8GB DDR4 (expandable to 16GB for sure) ##  512GB SSD ##  1650Ti graphics card ##  15.6 inch FHD display was enough for my need ##  with a budget of not crossing 60k after all discounts - this laptop is a good fit for my requirements. ####   First and farmost thing: Its a pain to have this laptop. ####   For this price range ##  this is one of the best products to opt for if you are interested in gaming/online class/daily chores ##  basically for students and regular use. ####   Laptop is awesome ####   Probably the best gaming laptop you can get for this budget. Gives 50-60fps for most games on high settings. Load times are incredibly fast ##  and it does not overheat. The battery life is on the lower side. Do not expect more than 3 hours of usage on a single charge while using a video calling app like zoom. ####    If you have the budget ##  GO FOR IT. No need to look on anything else. Firstly ##  it can be said ##  a laptop that runs game well does general works well. This model is tremendously fast and capable. I'm playing Days Gone PC at max settings (even with reshade applied to enhance quality furthermore) ##  and no lags I could notice. A great option at this price. And you've HP's brand value and trust too. ####   Very nice laptop...powerfull for gamming...sound and display quality is also good... running smooth... boot time takes around 5-8 sec... thanx to 512gb ssd... and the intel optane in superd we can use total of 40 gb as system memory ####   Best performance laptop under 70k.... better performance ##  good for gaming ##  good performance in Editing.... Battery lasts more than 3.5 hours with continuous useage with internet (without gaming and editing)......display was good graphic designers can go for it......No heating issues at all...speaker is clear ##  crisp and awesome it's a different experience on speakers..... hardware is quite good... Design as expected in pictures... ####   Very good product ####   Wonderfully laptop with bad battery backup ####   Bang for the buck.... This machine is 🔥🔥 ####   Camera Quality is very Poor & Some times Device Lags alot & battery backup is upto 3 hrs maxxxx so kindly buy other laptop ####   Nice product ####    Horrible experience with the laptop. First of all I received one product which was a used one then asked for a replacement and now the new one has keyboard issue and Spacebar issue. Don't buy HP laptops these are terrible. Not sure whether it is a fault of the vendor or HP but my experience is terrible with this. ####   Very impressive design and build quality performance is best in this price segment ##  sound quality is awesome and display is excellent also battery life is also normal ##  gaming performance is excellent no doubt ####   AFTER 10 DAYS OF USAGE: ####   Performance is awesome ####    We can use this for multipurpose... ####   It is a very good laptop at this price range. The speed and performance is good and can be used for multiple purposes other than gaming ##  like video-editing  ##  photoshop ##  office work etc. The speed can be enhanced by adding additional RAM. (Most compatible RAM for this model) ####   Battery life is vey poor. I think I cannot work without keeping the charger on... The charging is also quite slow. ####    GTA v work v I love it best even I play more super great music please buy this I watch"},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcer Nitro 5 Intel Core i5-11th Generation 144 Hz Refresh Rate 15.6-inch (39.62 cms) Gaming Laptop (8GB Ram/512 GB SSD/Win10/GTX 1650 Graphics/Obsidian Black/2.2 Kgs) ##  AN515-56 + Xbox Game Pass for PC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹89 ## 999.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹22 ## 009.00 (24%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available* # This laptop comes with the latest 11th Generation Intel Core i5-11300H processor giving the fastest single threaded laptop performance and higher performance # It also comes equipped with 4 GB of NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1650 so that you can enjoy an enhanced and seamless gaming experience # 39.6 cm (15.6\") display with IPS (In-Plane Switching) technology ##  Full HD 1920 x 1080 pixel ##  Acer ComfyView LED-backlit TFT # 8 GB of DDR4 system memory ##  upgradable to 32 GB so that you can multitask with ease. # This Acer laptop boasts a refresh rate of 144 Hz and an overdrive response of 3 ms so that the visual experience of your game is lag-free ##  fluid ##  and seamless.##", "no_of_rating": "110 ratings", "avg_rating": "3.8", "total_no_answer": "\n76 answered questions\n", "delivery_type": "Details", "delivery_date": "FREE Delivery", "Model": "Acer Nitro", "Brand": "Acer", "SpecificUses": "Personal, Creator, Gaming", "ScreenSize": "15.6 Inches", "OS": "Windows 10", "more_detail": "\nBrand\n#\n‎Acer\n\n\nManufacturer\n#\n‎COMPAL Electronics (CHONGQING) Co., Ltd., No.D01, Zone D, Air Port Section of LiangLu CunTan Free Trade Port Area, YuBei District,  Chongqing, China\n\n\nSeries\n#\n‎Acer Nitro\n\n\nColour\n#\n‎Black\n\n\nForm Factor\n#\n‎Laptop\n\n\nItem Height\r\n\n#\n‎24 Millimeters\n\n\nItem Width\r\n\n#\n‎36.3 Centimeters\n\n\nStanding screen display size\n#\n‎15.6 Inches\n\n\nResolution\n#\n‎1920 x 1080 Pixels\n\n\nProduct Dimensions\n#\n‎25.5 x 36.3 x 2.4 cm; 2.2 Kilograms\n\n\nBatteries\n#\n‎1 Lithium Polymer batteries required.

Defective from the beginning. They didn't even give replacement. ####   one of the best thermals out there intels new Alder Lake CPU with Nvidia RTX 3050 for smooth gaming ####   Everything is good about this laptop except for the poor battery life! ####   Waste of money for its price. ####   I bought this laptop 6 months before. For the 1st 4 months it's working fine. Later you will face heat issue. Already more YouTube videos are there. Sometimes lagging. Sorry more no times. Try to buy sole other brand. Even go with HP ##  Dell or some other brand as you wish. ####   I bought this laptop  ##  great experience apart from the speakers you can barely hear anything on full volume & the battery life isnt the best at all  ##  will last maybe 4-5 hrs doing normal tasks but about 2 hrs max on gaming  ##  everything else is good though ####   Product Excellent but Brand has lost its charm even beyond fifth class - My recent Personal Experience with Brand. So Not Recommended. ####   Been using this for almost 3 months.. performance is great..audio is average but rest all are great. ####   Super for gaming and editing ####   Okay ####   I purchased this laptop in a hurry when suddenly my mid-2015 macbook pro went dead. I use it primarily for software development purpose and so far the perfomance is good. I have upgraded the memory to 16 GB and added one more 500 GB SSD. I am not a gamer ##  so won't be able to comment on gaming performance. However ##  running application server ##  eclipse ##  25+ chrome/edge tabs and photoshop together hasn't shown any noticeable impact on the performance. I mostly use it with external monitor ##  mouse and keyboard. Apart from a few typical glitches with Windows 10 ##  I haven't faced any major issue so far. Planning to install Ubuntu/Centos on a separate partition soon. Two minor drawbacks are: battery backup is not very good ##  and camera quality is very basic. ####   Got it within 4 days ####   Go for it ##  it's a nice pick. ####   Its not starting ##  even its not charging as well ##  i have plugged it properly as mentioned in the manual still no charging Indicator is turned on nor the laptop. Cheaters ####   Both the instances ##  laptops didn't switch on. Had to return and get the refund. Don't go for this. Go for premium ones ####   The overall performance of the laptop is satisfactory till date. Both Acer & Amazon also sent the laptop with great packaging. Remember to push the charger pin all the way else it won't charge. F1-2020 ##  Call Of Duty running smoothly along with my daily work s/w like Visual studio ##  sql. ####   Good Gaming ####   Not working. Laptop charging also not working. Replaced product also same condition. Don't buy product from this supplier... ####   I set up the laptop and started using it as soon as downloaded a few apps like vlc Adobe the laptop showed a BSOD then later on I downloaded a game just after I enter the game it would show the BSOD again now when I played rogue company I got a BSOD code clock watchdog timeout error ####   First one that came was dead and it took almost 16 days to replace ####   Never ever buy a laptop if you want to do gaming. Get a desktop assembled. The overheating problem occurs with literally every laptop after 1 -1.5 yrs. And it's not only with acer ##  it's with all these brands. Just go for PC. Laptop is never preferable for gaming. ####   Good product ####   Do not purchase this product . All the reviews is just hyped . Purchase any other laptop than this. Not worth even one start ####    I suffered a lot with this laptop. There was a screen Flickr and Colours on the screen was also not appropriate. That too I noticed after 1 week of buying it. I have complaint multiple time in last 1 month. Also the Keyboard lighting change automatically even if you set it to a single color. Now I'm completely frustrated from it. ####   I bought this laptop about a week a ago and it has impressed me so far! It is expensive ##  yes but it pays off. It has excellent performance in gaming and it has 0 lag. The i5 11th gen processer is an excellent processer ##  Good for students and for gaming. The webcam quality is good too. The speakers aren't the best but they do the job ##  Also ##  for those who think the speakers are bad ##  you can simply just put on headphones. The keyboard lighting is amazing!!! Acer nitro 5 is one of the best gaming laptops out there if you have a budget up to about 70k.  One thing to keep in mind though is that it is a little thick and bulky and a little heavy but you can still carry it around. Just be careful while carrying it or you might drop. They keyboard typing keels good and the build quality is solid. Battery like is pretty good. One more advantage is that you can charge it on the back so there aren't to many wires on the sides of your laptop. Thermals are excellent too! You can also adjust fan speeds and keyboard lighting in the nitro software. Overall ##  I really enjoyed this laptop! I highly suggest buying it. ####   Good laptop ####   Display quality compromise but company fix that but there is no firmware update through company ####   Amazing product! ####   Worst service my Amazon delivery and seal was open when I receive the laptop no user manual was available getting hanging while playing and worst sounds system ####   I bought this laptop for multi tasking and this laptop nailed it.! Just ran gta 5 and pubg at a time and it worked without any lag. I had best experience with this. ####   It is not in working condition not getting on ####   The laptop is not charged at all. As well as charger is also not charging it. It is absolutely make us feel cheated about ordering online. ####   Love the Laptop. If you're looking for an excellent gaming laptop under 70k this is the best choice. ####   I am highly disappointed with the product ##  the first time I got a faulty product it did not even start ##  after replacement the second one which was suppose to be 1 TB HDD but was only 500 GB. ####   Worth the money ##  if anybodys laptop is unable to charge up ##  remember to push the pin inside the charger port all the way in. ####   Good for gaming and editing.I love it. ####   Best Gaming Laptop in this price range. Extremely happy with laptop performance. No issues with screen and design is absolutely perfect. ####   I got a faulty product the charger wasn’t working and i ordered the 1tb 256ssd variant but i got 512ssd variant delivered which was faulty even thou on my invoice it mentioned the 1tb variant. ####   Hanging and restarting blue screen error"},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP 15 10th Gen Intel Core i3 Thin and Light 15.6 inches FHD Laptop (8GB/1TB HDD/M.2 Slot/Windows 10/MS Office/Jet Black ##  1.74 kg) 15s-du1066TU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹43 ## 090.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹3 ## 600.00 (8%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available* Disclaimer-*The Windows 11 upgrade will be delivered late 2021 into 2022.

Recommended for semi professional jobs and students ####   Good processing speed ##  Nice keyboard and user friendly windows software. Good battery life!! ####   Display gone within 2 months of purchase ####   Very good laptop. Sound quality is good. 1TB strorage. Value for money ####   So far good to use ##  the camera and speakers are very good for online classes. ####   Hp website shows 9 months warranty instead of12 months waranty. It may be second hand product / technical error. I share the issue with hp customer support. They assure me to solve the issue asap.  But ##  Good laptop for daily normal or office use. But front webcam is too poor. ####   Good laptop. ####   My lap top is getting switch off after 1 month .duplicate product ####   Web Cam not working ####   Battery backup is low ##  and keypad is not looking good ####    Laptop display not working.  Laptop crashed. Purchased in June 2021. ####   It's k for my requirement ####   Very slow ####   If you want a low budget HP brand ##  you can buy it with your eyes closed . ####   Good for very basic wfh activities. In hindsight ##  I would suggest the same configuration and the buy o365 ##  as outlook is not included. Fan sound can be very loud at times. Like a takeoff. Again ##  very basic ##  but does the basic job. ####   Laptop is good lokkwise but a little bit slow in performance and the battery must be improved ##  although the price is attractive but better performance is expected from HP ####   5hr of Battery 🔋 life ##  ####   Superb ####   Battery backup is good.for general use it is very good. ####   Using this from last 1 month ##  haven't faced any issue yet ##  quite fast processor ####   I bought this laptop in June 2021. I'm writing this review on 3rd September. Within 3 months of period ##  it is giving me so many problems. First ##  the screen freezes in the middle of the session ##  the cursor is not at all moving. I have to restart the system ##  again and again ##  to make it work. It also gives a weird sound and stopped working. ####   Laptop is good..Performance is nice.. but battey back up is only for 3 hours ####   Goid ####   Nice ####   Very good processing speed ##  battery life is also very good overall very good laptop ##  must buy it. Gaming not tested yet. ####   Hangs ##  slow ##  frequent freezing. ####   Processing little bit slow but acceptable......overall i m submitting it after 10 use ......I felt it is good product ####   In 25 days my laptop battery is not working ####   Battery life as bow is good. ####   Laptop cover/body plastic is of low grade. ####   Awesome laptop for general use and online classes. ####   Large screen ##  very decent Large keyboard. Again ##  spacious touchpad. Comes with a free MS Office School Edition. ####   very good laptop for the budget ####   Battery life is not so good ..And my laptop gets heated up after using for just one hour .. Haven't got the warrenty card with the dilevery of laptop ####   Battery life wise very bad ####   Looks Good. ####   This is a good laptop to use for day to day activities. Screen is OK. Has good sound output. ####   It has a good battery life. It is very light. It is bad for gaming ##  but best for students. It has a nice RAM ##  Processor and Battery. Overall its a very nice amd smooth laptop ####   Too slow booting ####   I was getting better discount and some goodies If bought from Nehru Place - Delhi. ####   The condition of Laptop was ####   Best but warranty shows only 11 months ####   Every time it's take time ####   Very nice laptop. I bought it for 42k and in 6 months the price is 48k shocked by the price hike. The hybrid drive is very useful and the 8gb ram does the job in ease. This is a beast under the hood. Can't ask for a better deal in this budget. ####   Like ####   Booked this laptop for exchange of my dell. It's 7 yr old laptop a decently maintained. Delivery person upfront rejected to take it as it is having minor crack on the frame. It seems they are expecting brand new one to be exchanged. ... Beware of exchange program... ####   Got for online classes and light documentation browsing purpose. It's Good for online classes and simple office work. Boot and shutdown is quick use 2hrs battery goes from 100 to 60 % so I guess 4-5 hr backup. Does not feel heavy ####   Good product ####   Key board is not smooth ##  not elegant too. Charging is bit slow. ####   Writing after 2 weeks of usage. System response and performance is excellent. Thanks to HP and amazon for timely delivery of excellent product. ####   It was a very bad experience with hp laptp. ####   Worst ##  not worth for money. Post delivery service is very poor. Don't fall into thier lucrative offer. Service very poor ####   Reading good comments here ##  bought this. Been using this since 3 days ##  and I see slowness ##  installed only chrome. Chrome doesnt open fast ##  had to do some diagnostics to improve performance (marginal). I have now scheduled a technician visit ##  if that doesnt solve ##  I'm returning. ####   good wroking ####   The so called Amazon falsely sells the products stating 5% cash back will be given on using AmazonPay ICICI credit card. I spoke at least 10 times to customer care agents ##  it has been >30 days. No cashback is given to me till date. ####   Hope less product recomend none to buy such chienese products and we must boycott such chienese products hence further ####   My brother bought this laptop for he's kid and we got multiple issue performance and alot of bloatware application and when asked for replacement we was suggested to upgrade ram ##  we regret buying Hp rather than going for other brand worst product. Even ms office was for 60 days validation ####   The laptop feels very smooth with 256gb ssd and 1tb hard drive with 8gb Ram. Got a good offer from appario seller with ICICI Amazon pay card. Final price was 38k after instant discount and cash back. Go for it if your needs are personal without intense gaming or photo editing. ####   Excellent product. Boots up real fast. Plenty of storage. Ideal for WFH. ####   Pros: ####   Battery Life could have been better ##  other than it's a perfect purchase for me. Amazing sound quality. Amazon has best customer support🙏 ####   A good performer for my light weight tasks ##  worth the money ####   Overall a good laptop. Considering an 8gb ram the speed is a little low but can be acceptsd. ####   As per the description/offer announced by Amazon in the product catalogue ##  I was supposed to recive 5% cashback while using AmazonPay ICICI Credit Card. But ##  I have not received the cash back & am still waiting for the same. Request the concerned person to look into the same & do the needful. ####   Absolutely amazing product of HP.. ####   Pros ####   Guys only one feature is unique like system open and close 04 to 07 second ##  And this laptop has one biggest disadvantage no key board light with this laptop. ####   Simply superb! Great performance from the I3 processor and 8 GB of RAM. Display and screen brightness are awesome. Furthermore it has great space from its 1 TB HDD. Overall an exemplary product at an affordable price. Unfortunately the only flaw was the tricky activation of Ms office package. ####   It's been month since I bought this laptop and it's working good. ####   Slow while using game ##  only for basic software use and study ####   Slightly  worried ####   Quality is very bad ##  Not working completely slow ##  Arrange for door service. ####   Don't buy this ##  after using 3 months it's getting hanged. HP says it's OS - Software issue ##  and not ready to support even under warranty. They are not ready align technician to resolve issue. Remote support is just name sake. Stop buying HP product due to pathetic support ####   Pathetic. Windows is not working have to get it reinstall again and again ####   One of the worst ever product I received from Amazon. ####   Camera is not working. Error Code 45 0xA00F4244<NoCamersAreAttached> ####   I use it for official purpose. Laptop is very fast for it's ssd card. Of course not for gaming purpose as it has no graphics card. Slik ##  light weight. I am happy. ####   I am using it.its really fast. ####   I want a replace of the product..amazon send defective laptop to me. ####   Low quality body cost is high  price 35000 ke approx hona chea ####   Its very heavy that too when it's without dvd drive. Otherwise fine for study purpose. Better options are available. ####   plastic panel quality very poor then always ok but I'm not satisfied ####   This is light weight and have anti glare screen"},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 11th Gen Intel Core i5 15.6\" (39.62cm) FHD IPS Thin & Light Laptop (16GB/512GB SSD/Windows 10/MS Office/Backlit Keyboard/Fingerprint Reader/Graphite Grey/1.66Kg) ##  82FG014DIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹1 ## 04 ## 290.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹41 ## 300.00 (40%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available* Disclaimer-*The Windows 11 upgrade will be delivered late 2021 into 2022.

It like company wanted to liquidate this product and once it was liquidated run away kind of thing is here. Need assistance ####   My spouse got one of these three years ago ##  and this year I got one for me and another for my dad. It's the best work laptop simply because of how light it is. Less than a kilo ##  and looks like it too. And it is a rugged beast as well - the better half's laptop has survived many a fall without complaints ##  safe a few minor dents. ####   Just one line ##  I'm lovin' it. Got it for 93k.. value for money.. best battery backup ever.. excellent display.. for the work I do ##  due to 16:10 aspect ratio ##  I don't even have to scroll up n down.. makes  work very simple and fast.. I'm hoping this will last for atleast 4-5 yrs ##  considering the build quality.. ####   I'm really blown away when read about LG gram laptop. ####   There are options to upgrade the ssd and RAM ##  i upgraded the ssd ##  overall laptop is fulfilling all my requirements and the battery life is marvelous. ####   My brother Karan Arora recommended this laptop... It was unaffordable but he still managed to make me buy it 😁 ####   if you are in the market for laptop and your requirement is good battery backup with excellent screen then no one come close to LG Gram series. I was confused between Fujitsu UH-X and LG GRAM 16 but both laptops have pros and cons and ultimately I chose LG GRAM over UH-X. Advantages over UH-X are as per below : ####   I bought it on June 13 2021 at the price of 57K on during Amazon Great Deals. Light weight beast as Machine from LG with atleast 12-13 hours battery backup . Hats off to R&D team. ####   Its superb ####   The laptop came in excellent package - the package itself spells the quality and care shown by the makers LG towards their product - unlike all those makers like ASUS or DELL ##  this one was premium. Everything was neat and clean. The pc is incredibly light - if you look at the photos you'll understand. It looks like a 13\" laptop ##  though it's 15 inches! ####   Ordered it a few days ago in the Amazon sale and got a great deal.

Ltd. I did not face any problems in the delivered laptop. I tested my laptop for quite a long time. ####   It is very nice laptop  ##  go for it ####   Poor battery life. Even under normal usage it comes for 2-3 hours max. Gaming doesn't even come for 1hr ####    First of all I have received the same product without any external damages and delivery was also fast ##  delivered a day before the actual date. ####   Pros: ####   Bought this laptop for video editing purpose and as compared to my last laptop this laptop is a beast 🔥 Getting my video editing done smoothly now. It takes some time to render but the editing is super smooth. ####   Everything is good except battery life ####   If your budget is around 70k then go for it blindly. ####   Laptop is good. ####   Though the battery is low..as soon as u open the screen for work...its stops charging. Ita getting charged now only when u shut the laptop ####   😍 ####   maasive ... product... i like it..👍 ####   Amazing product..as expected. Really great. ####    Everything is good this review is based on one week useage there is no problem till now hope there will be no problem in further days.Here are some pros and cons ####   Battery life 5/5 ####   Amazon return policy/delivery guy is wrost. ####   Sound is not that great but laptop is nice ####   Review UPDATE: ####   Bought this laptop @66 k and it's worth for this price range. I am writing this after 2 days of continuous use. This lap is suitable for both gaming and office work. ####   Guys please do not buy. I am using this laptop for the past 8 months and here are the biggest cons of purchaing the laptop. ####   It's good choice ## go for 512 GB SSD variant ## I m using it for mainly gaming & it runs all games very smoothly. ####   Very good laptop with poor speaker and very good display 144htz with poor RGB accuracy. ####   If you are looking for a gaming laptop to handle the latest PC games without spending a fortune ##  then go for this. ####   Been 20 days using it ####   Some heating issue while playing game. Othewise very good quality Laptop. ####   Absolute garbage of a product in terms of gaming. Frames are 100-120 in even esports titles like valorant csgo. Not for gaming one bit ####   Poor quality body material/sharp edges ####   I am writing this review after nine months. I can say that its overall performance has been pretty good. The battery backup is around 5 to 6 hours when using it for activities other than gaming. The high graphics-intensive games run in the medium to low settings and while gaming the fan sounds a lot so it's better to use an earphone for the same. The laptop's sound quality is not so good and here also I would recommend plugging in earphones when you are watching a movie or TV series. Next ##  I want to talk about the structure and sturdiness of the laptop ##  and in this section ##  I would say that it beats all the laptops in this price range. The hinge support is completely different and for that ##  it will not crack around the edges. If you ask me it's a pretty decent laptop in this price range ##  you should go for it. ####   Good laptop ####   Good for a budget gaming laptop ####   Good purchase overall at 65k you will get nothing better. 4600H ##  1650Ti are great combination with SSD (I have upgraded 2TB HDD) IT WORKS ####   This is truly a beast when it comes to performance. The storage can be expanded upto 1TB hdd and 1TB ssd. The display is pretty good. ####   Got this one at an effective price of ₹61 ## 500 a few weeks back — so far so good. HP manufactures one of the most refined and stable products compared to brands like Lenovo ##  Dell & ASUS (based on personal experience ##  no bias) to make them last longer. Go for it if the budget isn't a constraint— anything below ₹70 ## 000 is justifiable for this one. ####   Truly amazing laptop I am really enjoying my time with it . I researched alot about this product before buying and it performed just like I expected not amazing but great  ##  i would recommend u to go for it if u are looking for a laptop in the this range  ##  only problem in  this laptop is the storage ##  but u can extend it later it's upto u . ####   Recieved 480 GB SSD where it was supposed to be 512 GB ####   After only two hours of receiving the laptop ##  bands started appearing on the screen ##  and they would gradually go away ##  but every time I restarted ##  they would occur again. I tried to apply for replacement but the product was not in stock. My last option was to go for a refund. 😩 This would have been my first laptop but now I'll have to get another one.... Sucks!! ####   Best laptop that's all I can say ##  got it @64490. Op hax everything is very good ####   It's freedback after using 4 days. It's very nice product at this price ##  and battery backup is so good. It gives 5 hours on Browing internet as well as continuous running Revit software. Also display with good quality. ####   Worth buy ####   Don't buy it even though good features having very poor built quality getting white screen scratch on screen which makes me irration on it warranty cannot apply because it's comes under physical damage better not to buy this laptop ####   I love my new laptop for so many things it has for me. Bomb gaming experience ##  cool design ##  screen resolution... ####   Product is good for gaming  ## and media consumption but for content creation display is not really upto standards. ####   Nice and best product under this pricr ####   Well best laptop available at this price range but ####    This is literally trash ##  I'm reviewing this after 7 months of usage ##  it was perfectly fine for 4 months then it literally became a trash ##  it is very bad for gaming don't go for this trash ##  The cpu temperature are in the video ##  there are massive FPS drops in the game it goes from 144 to 2 fps for 10 seconds frequently. ####   Nice product ####   This is the beast laptop bcz hp care services are too good and quick..I bought the laptop six months ago.HP support service I fully supported HP Support Service does not need to go to any service center.If a part breaks down ##  they come at home and serve and they provide good service....thanx Hpsupport india and the laptop is also good performance ####   It's a great product at this price point ## thermals are really very good! ####   As far as i have tested this laptop it always gives me the best performance. You can go for it but i have the 500gb ssd one hdd one might be slower ####   Have been using it since a month. Everything is good except the fact that it heats up quite quickly. ####   I hesitated at first to buy such a costly laptop online but i trusted amazon and went on to buy the product and i haven't looked back. Its just superb and just super smooth laptop for editing and gaming purpose ##  super fast boot and just amazing. ####   Got a faulty piece. The mouse pad had issues. It would make rattling sound  when moving the cursor. It was wobbly when clicked. I replaced it and got a new one it had same issues. The body seemed pretty cheap. A laptop that costs whopping 68 ## 000 is not supposed to have these issues. Not worth the hype. Not worth the money. Returned it. ####   The webcam is not working 😢 ####    The product is receive in extremely great Quality and it's performance is the best in this much of budget. ####   Great performance ####   It's speaker's maximum volume is lower than my phone's volume. ####   HP guys have informed that products sold on Amazon do not come with brand validity. If faulty pieces are received ##  warranty will not cover expenses at any authorised service centre. ####   First of all big thanks to Amazon to deliver this product within 3 days even in this pandemic situation ##  their supply chain is simple awesome. ####   Bought this on SEPTEMBER 1ST. (Post 5 months review) ####   Gaming quality is less ####   Except for option to have 16gb ram directly.Its a great laptop ####   In This laptop we can play games at high graphics with out any lag.

Purchased this for father who is a chess player. ####   Worst!! Not Worth it ####   Reviewing after using 15 days...4 GB RAM & 256GB SSD with 1.5 yrs of MacAfee antivirus protect  in 28K ##  an unbeatable deal. It is extremely good for online classes ##  downloading movies and doing basic work. With this price ##  dont expect a speed of 8GB RAM ##  but is totally fantastic with the price I paid for. Highly recommend it for basic use. ####   Good product. value for money. Good process under 30k. Cammera quality in low but processing is good with also ssd. ####   The SSD enables the device to start up quickly. The matte finish of the body is commendable. It comes with MS office 2019 version. In short ##  it's value for money. ####   Processor is little slow. Everything else is best. Good for normal work. Price is little high. I think minimum processor with Windows 10 64 bit should be 2 ghz. ####   Nice ####   Too good ####   Was delivered used product ####   This laptop have a ram issue appairo retail seller sold defective laptops which do not work properly and delivery was not quite good box was damaged and delivery boy laughing and also return very late please don't buy online laptops 🙏 ####   Every thing which is in this laptop is good..realy a good product ..i also get a gaminy keyboard ...which is 2700 rupees..😘😘🔥 ####   Very convenient to use. ####   It is good.i used it for normal work. I buy it when itbis unavailable 😂. I just tap it and buy option available even it was unavailable. I used it for daily work and for study.its performance is good  because I have installed beam ng and madout bigcity 2 online and it both runs good. On madout bigcity 2 online on faster graphics and full resolution it give 40 to 50 fps that is good . On beam ng which is of compressed 300mb give good performance but it heats to 70 to 80 degree Celsius. But it is not a problem. It is normal when you play a game .i have no issue for it. Also antivirus is pre-installed which is valid upto 10/2022 it prevents me from 1000+ risky connection and 2 viruses. It has ms office pre-installed which is a good thing. Also it takes 5 to 7 second to boot . The keyboard is of premium quality . ####   Battery  life is very good  also screen quality and speed  good  value for money  in this laptop  I like it's ####   Low in space ####   Affordable laptop with all the essential features ####   Except camera quality all features are so good. It's performance is so good. ####   Laptop is just amazing. Everything is very nice. Thnks amazon for this wonderful laptop🥰 ####   Good quality. ####   performance board ####   Good ####   Product is having display issue ####   best laptop under this prize point from dell. ####   Value for money product ####   Waste customer service from amazon ####   Product is good for money but thw worst part is Delivery service ##  the delivery service of Amazon Transportation Service is way worst cause the guy in the office are misbehaving they don't even know how to deal the costomer... ####   I like this product ... It is a good option for you. You will take it without any doubt ... ####   I recieved the product after 6 days of ordering. It works really fast and screen quality is fantastic ##  battery life is superb  ## light weight ## no heating issue ##  best laptop for work from home or office use. ####   I have purchased two days back for my son's online classes Fastness is good. Screen quality also good ##  But battery capacity is not satisfied. It comes down in one hour continues use for online classes. Value for money. ####   Value for money...in 30K range very good product..100% recommend ####   Good product 👌 ####   Nice ####   It's a good product ####   Not good. ####   Not as expected laptop. ####   Very good product. ####   Working  not properly this worst item it will work properly only 10 days after it will not work properly. Bad performance. Laptop is not opening. ####   Best product under 30k. build quility was super as i imagin with dell  ##  good battery backup it will last up to 5-6 hour with heavy use and 7-8 hour with light or modrate ssd speed is also amazing open any application in few seconds  ##  boot time is about 10to12 seconds  ## and charging time is about 1.5 hour . i highly recommend this just go for it. ####   Screen quality is good ####   Great product.. good pricing...👍 ####   I was looking for a laptop for my kid who needed a device for online school and and to learn programming. I was looking for a laptop with entry level processor with SSD ##  8GB ram and 15.6\" display. This one came close. Except for the 8 GB ram ##  it has everything else. Ram can be upgraded later on. ####   Product finishing...Screen Size... Speed.... etc etc... ##  everything perfect..... Value for Money☑️ ####   i didn’t get the invoice.... ####   Camera quality very poor ####   Nice product for kids ####   Battery life and touch screen is good ##  but camera quality is ok. ####   And a very good performance laptop from Dell. For poor folks like me who graduate from a tablet to a laptop. Fast and crisp performance. Go for it if heaps of storage is not a issue for you. ####   The laptop is light weight with not much powerful processor ##  but the best part is due to SSD the boot-up and shutdown time is 1-2 seconds. All the applications are working smoothly. Laptop comes with 1 Year Dell basic warranty ##  Genuine Windows 10 which needs to be activated ##  MS office 2019 student subscription and 15 Months McAfee antivirus subscription. Battery life is good and with moderate use can last upto 5 hrs.

Rs.41000/- is waste for this machine. ####   HP is a global brand ##  and it makes me feel global when I work on a HP ####   MS-excel is missing in this product ##  shocked to notice this ####   Slow start and slow in functioning. ####   Took 15 Min to boot. Slowed down many times and was hanging in between. Then automatically get restarted suddenly. Took the support of HP center many times & finally returned. Please don't buy. ####   Mere hisab se paise ke hisab se ekdam bekar hai ## bahut jyada hang kar rha hai aur bahut slow hai ####   Body and keyboard plastic material is very poor ##  Battery last for 2-2.5 hrs maximum ####   Never buy HP products because their technical team has 0 knowledge about their products and they always give stupid reasons .......... Also they transfer call to one another saying they will solve but you will never get solution... not only this they will say you about call back which you will never get and at last they themself say why did you buy the hp product... ####   Very worst and poor performance and taking the much time to open the applications and folders as well. It’s did not meet the expectations as per the item description. And Amazon is misleading the public with fake information and without quality check of products they are selling and making the customers fools. I sincerely request to all don’t encourage this product and as well as Amazon as well. This is not 1st time it was happened earlier and I had a bad experience with the same HP product. Finally the same issue has happened. I really fed up with Amazon customer service and products. Don’t believe Amazon especially with electronic gadgets. ####   The all round performance of the laptop is good. But battery life is a little less than certified by the company. ####   This product is total waste of money ##  system is very very slow. I regret i bought it ####   Bought this laptop last week ##  and it has stopped working. Never recommend anyone to go for it. I don't understand why laptops in this price range are worst in India. ####   Give me this laptop by replacing it because in 2 months the motherboard of my laptop has blown. I will not recommend this laptop to anyone because it has a lot of issues. I don't want to give it even 1 star.And one more thing I bought this laptop from Amazon. I'm so annoyed with Amazon and HP ####   I like it very much ####   Good product ####   I did't like this ####   I bought this Laptop considering HP name. However ##   this Laptop is disappointing. Using for 3 months now. first ##   it is extremely slow. takes lot of time to startup. Second ##  it gives problem in running exam software which usually runs on other Laptops. When i click on hardware diagnostic ##   it goes into restart mode and doesn't come up. i had to shut down restart atleast 10 times and then it came up. Better to get laptop from US ##  Singapore if you know someone for good quality. ####   I don't like it at all as it is very slow to open ####   The laptop is very hang when we open and take long time time to open the window ####   I am using since 2 months ##   its very eay to use ##  easy to install all applications. I booked installation service which helped me divide the hard disk into 3 allocations. Windows and Microsoft Office are lifetime valid. I also use for multiple software applications ##  rarely lags. ####   Worst product.. don't buy..dam slow ####   Good performance except the start and power off time required. ####   Services are horrible ##  it's mike.and camera issue persists for last one month no support from HP ####   Very goods 💞 quality and most importantly so I purchased repeat it and my experience very good for it product ####   I bought this laptop in July 1st. ####   The product is worst. It is a 11th gen i3 processor ##  but the performance is dead slow. The display is faulty. Lot of white spots on the display when the screen is black. Poor customer service from Amazon. Still waiting for service arranged by Amazon. They sell faulty electronic items and do not allow refund to return. Who need a replacement faulty device? Bad experience ####    Laptop is good ##  It seems very slow at start and over a period no issues... I am using for 2  months and no challenge till now. ####   Product is really good  ##  and I checked as it is having 4 gb graphics card  ##  it even run GTA 5 on high graphics . Overall best for any student or home laptop.......... ####   Ran smooth for some days but getting hanged and runs very slow even to open a folder or clicking start button. Can it be fixed somehow ? ####   The supplied product is defective in its working and operation. It automatically shuts down suddenly and then automatically restarts in 10 minutes to come to original screen. This is a problem in the product ####   Very cheap quality. Fell from my lap and monitor not workjng ####   Battery back up is very poor ####   Very bad product. Battery life is very poor ##  shows 0% charge even after connecting to the charger. System is very slow. The laptop is closed automatically. Don't buy it. ####   Laptop takes very long time to start and shut down. Otherwise the experience is average. No advantage of 11th generation laptop is seen. ####   HI I HAD PURCAHSED THIS LAPTOP IN JUNE WITHIN 1 MONTH THE LAPTOP IS NOT WORKING WHEN I RAISED TO HP INDIA THEY ARE SOME PART ARE DAMAGED AND THEY WILL REPLACE HOWEVER IT 25 DAYS STILL NO RESOLUTION FROM THEM. ####   The product was defective and it took a couple of months to just initiate a return . Calling the customer support for help took a while . The technicians didn’t turn up at all. The person who came to take the return item didn’t have patience to turn on the laptop and check the serial number and did not pick up the item . The second time after initiating the return I just received a message that said couldn’t pick up the item from customer . I’m always home  ##  no calls from Amazon but just received a message that the item could not be picked up . I had a lesson that valuable items should not be ordered online . ####   Please don't west your money ####   Pathetic Product. ####   Awesome laptop ####   I have been using this for a couple of months. Initially the setup of the laptop would be slow.Please make sure that you are connected to a good internet connection. All good once the initial setup is completed.Battery life ##  performance are excellent. Best in this price range. Got it for 37k. ####   Excellent👏 ####   Supper ####   Like ####   This laptop has become black and white and I could see pink lines coming through it......even the customer care aren't doing anything ####   Takes time to start which is unusual for i3 with 8 gb ram ####   Sensitive keypad keys. Slow Processor speed. ####   Speed is something slow ####   Using this for domestic purpose. It's wonderful experience!!! ####   Value for.money ####   It's hanging always ####   I recieved laptop after  5 th days. IIS not working I showen in hp show he as given me doan letter it is not ####   Worse laptop it's very very very very slow ##  keep on hanging. Touch pad not working properly. It's horrible to work on this laptop 😭😭😭😭 ####   It’s very slow! ####   Very light fibre ####   Very good quality and very good battery life. ####   The mic was not working from day one called HP NO PROPER SUPPORT. THUS ASKED TO RETURN AND REFUND ####   Laptop is still slow I have one doubt it is small size when I checked it is only 14inch so I fell so sad ####   match all basic expectations ##  good performance ##  sturdy. ####   Very much like this product and very good for on line classes. ####   3rd class quality ####   It's best !!! ####   Damp slow. Completely useless ####   Laptop is very slow and hanging every time ##  Do not buy this laptop. ####   Worst product  ##  I can’t give single star also ####   Laptop's screen broke while working ##  in just 2 weeks time ! It was not mishandled or dropped. Just broke while using it. HP conveniently says display not covered. Please avoid buying the laptop ####   Disgusting Product.. ####   I just got this yesterday and it took close to 4 hours to get it setup. Even after spending that much time ##  here are some issues still bothering me. ####   Nice product ####   Please do not buy this product.Amazon has cheated on me.This Laptop is very very very slow.Once you buy can’t be changed ####   Usefull and shop prise more ## but this discounded by 3000 rs ####   I don't have any issue with laptop... It's working pretty well. But I ordered this on 9 months instalment in that I had to pay 4883/- per month. But recently when I got bank statement they are charging extra 18% GST on instalments. They are charging 5320 per month. I have to pay extra 4500 rupees I mean it's just ridiculous. Everything should be clear in the beginning. How you are supposed to do like that with your customers? Giving 3 stars just for laptop. ####   Good product.but bit slow when you start it. ####   Worst performance . Very slow. ####   Very slow system. Better to go for another system. Sometimes it will stuck and opens very slowly..... ####   Performance is not upto the mark ##  remain will be good. ####   Product is good for normal users ##   video editing is slow. Need to improve means definitely power socket in laptop is at the edge of corner sometimes cord comes out while charging from laptop end ####   Very bad experience of after sale service. Laptop is too much slow ####   Wireless card seem to be defetive. Frequently wifi gets disconnected inspite of internet connection is available. Not sure if this can be exchanged now in warranty"},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMi Notebook Pro QHD+ IPS Anti Glare Display Intel Core i5-11300H 11th Gen 14-inch(35.56 cms) Thin and Light Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Iris Xe Graphics/Win 10/Backlit KB/Fingerprint Sensor/1.4 Kg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹69 ## 999.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹13 ## 509.00 (19%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Processor: 11th Gen Intel Tiger Lake Core i5-11300H processor| Speed: 3.1 GHz(base) - 4.4 GHz(max) | 4 cores | 8 Threads | 8 MB Cache # Display: 14 inch IPS QHD+ resolution (2560x1600) |16:10 aspect ratio ##  100% sRGB ## 215 PPI ##  1000:1 contrast ratio | Anti Glare | TUV low Blue light # Memory & Storage: 8GB DDR4 3200 MHz | 512GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD # Operating System & Software: Windows 10 Home | Microsoft Office Home and Student 2019 # Graphics: Intel Iris Xe graphics##", "no_of_rating": "135 ratings", "avg_rating": "4.3", "total_no_answer": "\n101 answered questions\n", "delivery_type": "FREE delivery:", "delivery_date": "EMI", "Model": "Mi Notebook Pro", "Brand": "MI", "SpecificUses": "Personal", "ScreenSize": "14 Inches", "OS": "Windows 10 Home", "more_detail": "\nBrand\n#\n‎MI\n\n\nManufacturer\n#\n‎Xiaomi, Nanchang Huaqin Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.

He says please return the laptop and we we refund your money. But ultra very good. I think Pro version is also good. But some technical issues.... The return policy time is over.. but Amazon service is simply superb... because my money credited immediately. ####   Copy in the design from MacBook Pro is with genuine intention to give the best experience… ####   Nice and attractive laptop ####   Likes ####   Dis likes: keyboard backlit from f8 key to macro are little bumped weirdly and hinge is good but the Black round matte they used is not straight... It's like a Little wave Matt in between screen and keybord. Battery is giving 5hrs. Speakers are very minimal ####   I purchased it on the first sale. I have kept it on changing now and it is giving me heavy electric shocks. ####   This is good all rounder laptop ##  but sound volume is really a concern. You can't enjoy movies or youtube videos with this sound. ####   Awesome built quality. Top Notch Display. ####   Its Overall killed the market. Seriously build quality ##  display ##   processor ##  battery life ##  iris xe gpu ##  fingerprint ##  free upgrade to windows 11 & the price..😍😍😍 ####   I am writing this review after 1 week of use ####   I just loved this product ####   The laptop is good. Display is fantastic when compared to Lenovo. My only issue was the outer package was fully opened. ####   ... if you are looking for a non-touch screen ##  non-heavy-gaming ##  Intel cpu ##  compact laptop. If fine with AMD cpu ##  there can be alternative ##  but otherwise ##  really no. So far ##  behaved all exactly a Windows Laptop should do ##  no complaints. Build quality is better than my third office laptops of twice the price. Only missing thing (other than no touch screen) is IR camera ##  so face unlock does not work. Rest all ##  including properly smoothen metal edges ##  proper rubber grip at the bottm ##  proper quality USB C charger and cable ##  bright vibrant screen with proper high resolution ##  all 4 sides thin bazels ##  one time office 2019 license (not that 365 which will make you pay every year) all good and as expected. ####   Nice build quality ####   I like the design ####   The hit  : ####   Awesome Built quality and Faster ####   I'm using i7 16GB variant. I love the display ##  keyboard. I can turn on and login into windows within 10s. I bought this only for coding so I haven't played any games. Not yet. ####   When ever I see any video screen is becoming black for a second or 2 seconds.. its happening frequently ####   Very nice laptop easy for programming ####   I bought this laptop on 31st AUG. Received before promised time from Amazon. I used the machine for few days  ##  everything looks good. Suddenly last week i found that one of key ( bracket character next to P) is not working. I called Amazon ##  they said you should contact MI since 10 days period is over (WOW...). I called MI Support they asked me to raise Token. I raised ticket and after that I am just following up from 5-6 days. They keeps saying ##  part is not available. I requested them to replace since it is just 15 days  ##  but not response. Still I am waiting for their response. MI should think to upgrade their service they made good machine but it is useless if you cann't support even for manufacturing defects. AMAZON ##  I have been using your platform from last 5-6 years. I use buy almost everything that i need from Amazon but this time I am upset ##  Why do you tieup with such companies who doesn't have proper Support System for such high value items. You should re-think for 10 days replacement policy for High Value Items on your platform otherwise you will loose trust of your customers. ####   Product build is sturdy and mesmerizing ####   it's backlight keyboard ##  high resolution display and larger TouchPad makes my productivity easier. ####   Super slim and very compartable ####   Touchpad not working ##  just after return period is over. I am using Mouse ####   I'm not going to give you the specs or list down pros and cons. It's obvious now. ####    It's just too attractive ##  the build quality ##  display ##  battery ##  keyboard ##  touchpad all are soo good ##  the feel of full metal body and sturdyness is just too good. If your budget is around 60k then don't think just go for it... Too much value for the money you are going to spend.. 🔥🔥🔥 ####   This will bring rapid change in the laptop market as this is value buy ####   It is a beautiful laptop. Very lightweight. Though the charger has a brick ##  it is very small and doesn't add much weight. The battery backup is of about 7-8 hours ##  not 11 hours as it is mentioned. However ##  it is decent. ####    DONT BUY!!! DONT BUY!!! No extended warranty offered by the manufacturer if you purchase from Amazon. MI AND AMAZON both fight and mi doesn't want you to purchase from Amazon so they won't help you with any support like warranty ####   Battery life is ok  and sound quality is very poor they have a look on sound quality for better cinematic experience.. ####   Every thing is good except it's weight distribution ####   Just got this laptop today ##  so based on just a few hours of usage. ####   The laptop is good but beware that MI will not support Brand Extended Warranty. ####   This is a good laptop in terms of performance and build quality. Xiaomi has cut corners in the following areas- ####   Tough and beautiful. A well balanced laptop by Xiaomi. Bought 8gb version as it was sufficient for browsing and studying. Go for 16gb only if you are a coder or creator. Screen ##  battery life ##  keyboard are all great. ####   Amazon not returning the product inwant a refund for tha same ####   1. Hi friends it's genuine review I am using the laptop past 2 day except battery life all are good especially display and performance extraordinary ##  as per the mi guide lines battery life given as 11 hr but I noticed it's 6 hr only. ####    All update will modify as i keep using.. but display is best as I was bit skeptical about earlier... But it won't disappoint you ... ####   I am not going to write those specs again. ####   😊😊everything is great.. ####   Notebook pro 16gb ram is just lit ##  can be called as a Windows macbook. ####   5/5 Build quality ####   Only one cons sounds is too low ####   Build quality of the laptop is excellent although instead of buying a 16gb ram varient  ##  after installing few 3d designing softwares programs sometimes got stuck a little or do not respond. ####    Writing this review after a week of usage . I'll add here pros and cons . So you can decide the verdict. ####   This is My 4 Days Review About This Product ####   Am not going to write about pros and cons. It's my experience with this order. ####   I got this laptop on 7th sep  ## This is my first ever laptop ####   Pros ####   An excellent laptop for 60k. The only complaint I have is about the charger ##  would've been really better if they had given a compact charger like realme did. This mi charger is bulky.i have a 65w adapter and it is not supported for charging on this laptop. Apart from this everything is good. One star less for the bulky charger. ####   from every aspect (build quality ##  compact  ## boot speed ##  looking wise ##  backlit KB) laptop is good except sound quality. ####   Overall laptop is good but there is heat up problem ####   Great laptop under this price range display is top notch thermals are great battery is good so slim and build quality is another level macbook at lower price.totally glad for purchasing it. ####   Overall it's a good laptop. The charging adapter could have been improved ##  the deisgn is still old and bulky to today's standard. ####   All the pros just one cons 'the speaker'. ####   Very nice machine ##  at good price ##  built is top notch ##  performance is perfect for price and compact form. ####   CONS: ####   Great laptop ##  great battery ##  display and processor all are performing awesome. 16 gb ram is more than enough ##  just go for it. Value for money. ####   I won't tell all good things which YouTube channels are promoting. Good part is overall laptop is good. I will rate 3.5 star out of 5. ####   Today I got my product delivered and I m very happy to use it it has very good battery backup ##  premium look only thing missing was a good quality speaker ####   With this price nice 14 inch laptop with 16 GM Ram 🙏 ####   The piece is defective. I have been waiting for my laptop for so long and this is what I got. ####   Hi Guys ##  From the user experience ##  It has excellent build quality ##  Light weight ##  Finger print sensor is very quick ##  Backlit keyboard is awesome ##  Extremely superb. I brought i5 16gb variant for programming. Its a perfect windows macbook edition. ####   Nice 👍👍👍👍👍 ####   Pros - lovely display ##  fast fingerprint reader ##  Ms ####   Happy with the product!! ####   Mi notebook pro i5 8GB got for Rs 54000 with HDFC offer. ####   I am fully satisfied with the purchase. Feeling like really a pro while using the lap. Best choice in this price go with the 16gb ram. ####    This is the best laptop one can buy in this price range ####   Ratings - ***** ####   No Cons ##  A good device for productivity"},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP 14 Ryzen 5 5500U 14-inch(35.6 cm) FHD Laptop with Alexa Built-in(8GB/512GB SSD/Windows 10/MS Office/Natural Silver/1.46Kg) ##  14s-fq1030AU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹56 ## 162.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹5 ## 172.00 (9%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 5500U (2.1 GHz base clock speed ##  up to 4.0 GHz max boost clock ##  8MB L3 cache ##  6 cores) # Memory: 8 GB DDR4-3200 MHz RAM (1 x 8 GB) ##  upgradable up to 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) | Storage: 512GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD # Display: 14-Inch (35.6 cm) FHD anti-glare micro-edge ##  250 nits ##  45% NTSC (1920 x 1080) # Operating System & Preinstalled Software:Pre-loaded Windows 10 Home with lifetime validity ##  FREE Upgrade to Windows 11* (when available ##  refer product description for more details) | Microsoft Office Home & Student 2019 ##  Alexa Built-in # Graphics: AMD Radeon Graphics##", "no_of_rating": "432 ratings", "avg_rating": "4.4", "total_no_answer": "\n419 answered questions\n", "delivery_type": "Details", "delivery_date": "FREE Delivery", "Model": "HP Laptop 14s-fq1030AU", "Brand": "HP", "SpecificUses": "Personal", "ScreenSize": "14 Inches", "OS": "Windows 10 Home", "more_detail": "\nBrand\n#\n‎HP\n\n\nManufacturer\n#\n‎HP Inc., HP India Sales Pvt.

Working well for that purpose. With the SDD boot up is double quick. Minor issue is the power button does not have a light to indicate it has taken the input and it takes about 10 seconds to light up the screen. In that time you are bound to press it again ####   The processor is great for multi tasking. Although the multi core usage probably comes into play when you are looking to play games that utilises those capabilities. ####   Hello All ##  hope this review will helps you out! ####   Very good product.Battery is super and screen quality is also good.It boots ver fast and the sound is superb. ####   Within two months of my purchase ##  there were few over brightened white pixels appeared on my screen.

BATTRY LIFE IS GOOD. SUPER IMMPRESSIVE THING IS HIS SPEAKER.MINDBLOWING LOUD SOUND WITH CRISPY AND CLEAR. FOR MULTITASKING IS WAS AN BEAST. OVERALL AT THE RANGE OF 50 TO 51K. IT WAS AN EXCILLENT DEAL. ####   Folks if you have bought HP laptop please check battery. This is 3rd HP laptop I bought ##  all were draining to zero battery overnight (from 100%) when kept on hibernation. Any drop in battery more than 2-5% while on hibernation is alarming. Luckily Amazon replaced last 2 laptops. ####   Excellent product & THANK YOU SO MUCH AMAZON SERVICE  which I book Yesterday at Night around 10.45 pm. & I got delivered today at morning around 10.00 Am  what a fastest delivery Thanks alot  for Such best laptop 💻 & I recommend to BUY  All user to grab it this product FROM HERE  & PLUS I GOT COUPON OF  3YEAR EXTENDED WARRANTY ALSO  WITIN A DAY ..

Particular Model may be defected. ####   Nice work ####   Great performance! ####   excellent product. The battery time is about 4 - 5 hours max ####   Good battery life. ####   Have been using this laptop for the past couple of days and haven't had any issues yet. It's good value for money. ####   Good quality... ####   The performance is good... Sleek & Stylish; hands down! ####   Performance ##  quality  ##  speed is Super. Worth buying at this price ####   good for students ##  Missing touch screen. and a metal body would have been ideal. Overall a very good Laptop. you can play games too ##  ####   I like it ####   Certainly ##  the Best 14 inch HP Laptop to be launched this year. Ryzen 5500au delivers smooth performance clubbed with 8 Gigs of RAM to deliver a masterpiece. ####   im using it only for study purpose . battery life is ok .but there's heating issue . ####   The performance of the laptop is top-notch but something don't know why it will take time to open. ####   Educational ##  Team meeting ##  presentation ##  programming ####   No issues.....it's a good product... ####   Anit-glare is not important spec. ####   It's battery life good. Good audio and video quality. Good for studies and office purpose.I dislike the screen framing material. It doesn't look good. ####   Don't Buy This ##  While Checking Waranty I get extended warranty not Manufacturers Warranty. ####   It's a budget laptop . I have purchased it at 49.5k . If you need a multicore performance then definitely Go for it. Otherwise go for intel processor based laptop. ####   Everything thing is good. I'm full satisfied ####   If you have budget around 50-55k buy this laptop. ####   The pc is great and very responsive its been 2 months now and is working fine no complaints ####   I have purchased my machine from from Amazon on 23-Apr-2021. I am  regular user of my laptop and single hand user. After few days i felt there is some impression mark on my laptop screen then when i check carefully it is full keyboard impression came on screen. It is looks very bad during use. I called so many times to HP support center  ##  mail sent and whats app message also but still there is no positive response. I never expect this type customer service from HP (Well known brand value). ####   Awesome. Great ####   I am a fan of HP Laptop products.So I purchased this best performer.Its been a month I bought this model.Its lightweight ## good batterylife ## and good IPS display.Its really so fast.I am totally happy with this and I recommend it to all.Special factor i liked was its backlight keyboard. ####   I have used this laptop for more than 2 months now ##  and personally haven't faced any issues at all. ####   Boots up fast and handles most tasks really well. Couldn't be more happy. AMD processor rocks. ####   Got this laptop with another amazon account. Delivery was no hassle ##  on time. ####   Good ####   It started hanging within months ####    The top cover is very bad. It's cracking.The screen backside  is cracking by itself. Not sure why with less than two months I am facing this issue. The system works well still the outer cover is cracking. Please see the pictures. Kindly let me know what to do? Can you do a exchange or help me in replacing the screen cover? ####   Worst ##  I received a different model number which is not present in HP website. Seems like a fake product... ####   Decent product ####   Works fine ####   Battery life performance and sound quality is awesome best laptop to buy in this budget. ####   Very nice Laptop ####   Pretty good quality ##  and very fast booting and operational speed. ####   Screen qulity and build quality is best. Best laptop for students for coding and other official works. Best laptop under this price segment 😍😍 ####   HP SUPPORT IS PATHETIC. YOU CAN NOT EVEN FIND THEIR CALL CENTER NUMBER.. SOMEHOW IF U GET IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR SUPPORT MODEL... DON'T THINK THAT IF U CALL THEM AND UR ISSUE RESOLVED. HARD THINK IS TO LAUNCH UR COMPLAINT.. I STRONGLY SUGGEST NOT TO GO WITH HP PRODUCTS.  avoid it. Also this model is not value for money... its actual best buy cost is 42k..but just Due to shortage price is inflated.. go for lenevo like brand. ####   I am a student and I needed a laptop for my online classes. This product was the best option in a budget. I got this for 53990/- ####   I've had a good experience with this ##  it's fast ##  glossy screen doesn't bother much ####   Heat production is more other than everything is good. ####   A gem of a Product. ####   Great Product ##  8gb ram expandable to 16 gb. ####   Very smooth only cons is non anti glare display. Better than intel i5 for multitasking ####   Bought this for online classes. Laptop is good in terms of processor ##  screen quality etc for the price. The speaker sound clarity and camera is decent and sufficient for the classes. Boots up quickly. As of now ##  battery goes down to 40 to 50% from a full charge after 3 classes of 45 minutes each. However ##  build quality could have been better to add more value for money. ####   Value for money and battery life is good and brightness OK. Anti glare OK. ####   No issues yet ####   First time laptop user.. I feel like I bought a flagship laptop.😄 ####   Good laptop at reasonable price.. ####   Product have new ryzen 5 5500u processor and backlit key that's the highlight.  No antiglare display ##  display colors slightly change according angle ##   sometimes Product heat ##  Hinges just OK ##  ##  but designed and look is classy ##  product made of good quality plastic. ####   Perfect ok. ####   I purchased the device on 22nd June and got it on 24th June. ####   This laptop is awesome but is not anti glare as promised. ####   After unpacking the product the display panel is clearly not fitted on the left panel ####   Old product was delivered. ####   Awesome performance! ####   I bought many laptops with HDD with intel processors in the past and was expecting a laptop to be fast and cool so I decided to buy a Ryzen with ssd but this really disheartened as it is heating too much even without installing a single software yet. I asked Amazon for replacement ####   I like design ##  battery life  ##  Processing ##  ####   Don't buy this laptop at 54 ## 000 because this is available in 50 ## 000 on 15 days agooo  wait until price low ####   Nice products in this price range. Elegant look and nice performance so far. ####   Good performance base laptop. Laptop started within 10 sec. ####   Booting speed and performance good.nice one ####   Great laptop. ####   Battery life is great. Colours are nice. No screen bleeding. Backlit is superb. Multitasking is better than i5 .Jst go for it . windows 11 is supported. Wifi and Bluetooth version are the old one but didn't cause any problem. Network speed was superb. If ur budget is 50k then definitely go for it . Overall best product at this range . Only thing is that buy from appario retail it is genuine. By the way I bought from reliance digital at 49500. U can check in reliance digital site it stocks up every alternate dates. Thank u 😏 Upvote ####   Laptop's specs are good. Configuration wise this laptop is amazing. However ##  the build quality of this laptop is not upto the mark. The quality could have been better. ####   BEST LAPTOP FOR CODERS AND MULTITASKERS AT THIS RANGE. ####   Best laptop in 50k ####   *First read all points after pressing the buy now tab. ####   Worth buying this product . Go ahead ####   Bought  this for Personal  Coding  using  Visual Studio ##  VS Code and SSMS all works smoothly. The review  after 2 days.The laptop  looks very attractive  than the sample pictures  shown here. ####   In product description it is mentioned anti-glare display. But the product screen is super reflective. Didnt expect this from amazon. ####   OVERALL LAPTOP IS GREAT ####   Battery life is worst. And it's gpu is very bad. Plz don't buy it . It is not value for money."},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS VivoBook 15 (2020) Intel Core i3-1005G1 10th Gen ##  15.6\" (39.62cms) FHD Thin and Light Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD + 32GB Optane Memory/Office 2019/Windows 10/Silver/1.8 Kg) ##  X515JA-EJ362TS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹50 ## 990.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹13 ## 000.00 (25%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available.

Even applications like google chrome. I bought this laptop in urgency and I regret it. This is the worst way to ever invest your money into tech. Your phone would perform better as a laptop than this. Of course ##  I can't do much now than to wait till I can buy a new one. Buy it if you want to regret later. ####   7 second boot-up is best part above all. ####   Excellent product. ####   This laptop is perfect for professionals seeking to buy one that is lightweight ##  has MS office access and a smooth interface. ####   Pixelate screen not able to use photoshot ##  blurry screen looking as fake ####   Battery backup is not too good but overall nice performance ####   Best laptop for the range of 40k speed is realy good and verry smooth to use.

Luckily ##  I didn't order antivirus separately for this laptop and was planning to order after sometime. ####   It has one of the best features at the price.

Now there is no way to reach there customer care either they dont reply on mail  ##  phone or anything. ####   How can i get it repaired? It has 2 year warranty? ####   Good price and quality..but camera is poor and wifi adapter should be 5G enabled at this specs n price . ####    This is my first lenevo laptop with worse experience please don't buy this. I brought it just 2 month before and within two months there are alot of issue I motherboard and ram is not working now screen is damaged and audio driver is also not supporting. It is under warranty so Lenovo service center provide all the services and part free of cost but it is quite headache to call them again and again for repairing. ####   Facing challenges with the screen. It has developed a hairline crack causing display problems. We have repeatedly tried calling Lenovo support number since the product is well within the warranty period but there's been no response. Suggest not to consider Lenovo laptops given the poor or no response to service calls. ####   I am writing this review after using this laptop almost 1 year ##  as per the price range laptop is average ##  aound quality is bery low ##  screen quality is also average ##  this is just a normal browsing laptop. There are many other options available better than this in same price range. I have brought this around 38K. ####   Meets my requirements ##  very fast and sleek ##  thankyou ####   Touch and feel is ok. There are few sharp edges. Machine boots up fast ##  all thanks to SSD but battery doesn't last for even 3 hours. This should have been improved for the given price. ####   Thin and lightweight laptop. Good product in budget to use regularly for daily work. ####   The worst experience since I use Amazon. ####   I buy it for my brother ...n he's just feeling wow ....thnks fir the great features ... ####   Loved it ####   Where is windows 2019 MS office....student and home. Its just office 365. ####   The product arrived in pristine condition with all the features loaded ..The installation was very simple . All you had to do was switch on and follow the instruction . PLEASE dont buy the installation service separately as it's not required . Overall satisfied with the product ####   This is basically making fool of customer ##  who will imagine today that an i3 10th Gen Laptop with 8 GB RAM and 256 SSD hard disk will not have HD Camera. ####   1 ####   Ok ####   Excellent for students and professionals with programming needs. ####   Really nice performance even after 1 month. ####   Cool ####   Overall value for money. ####   I am facing problem since two months ##   nobody is responding ####   There is no extended warranty at reasonable price ####   Few things are missing. Eg: better camera ##  FHD screen. But ##  serves the purpose of a student. If you're a student then go for it. You won't be disappointed. ####   Worst product I have ever buy ####   Poor battery backup ####   Received the laptop with damaged screen. ####   Battery life is maximum 3 hrs in new ####   Terrible camera. Average build quality. Average battery life. Decent value for money. ####   All good with the product. My child liked it too. Camera not up to mark. Lenovo should improve it. Else reaaly liked the product. ####   with in 1month most of the keys are not working. ####   My selection based on the stated specs and features was reasonably good except for the fact that MS Office is without Outlook ##  which is a let-down. ####   Nil ####   Good laptop ##  working properly. ####   yet to find ####   Both positive and negative mentioned together ####   light portable and display is very good. ####   overall a good product and fullfills the promises ####   Very light weight but Camera quality and battery life is poor ####   Product price high quality not setesfi ####   Best low budget laptop and good performance. ####   lenovo is all time my favourite ####   Battery life of this laptop is very poor. Hard to continue an online class of only one hour. Also web came is pathetic. ####   it is easy it lift ##  it is a a wonderful product ####   Overall good except camera quality. ####   Good ####   Nice laptop but completely run on wifi ##  lan port not available. Easy and ready to use microsoft office inbuilt. Light weight easy to carry. ####   D Fri ####   Good. ####   Laptop is not starting. It is only 2 months now and problem started . Seems like battery problems or bios issues. Is it refurbished? ####   superb thin laptop ####   Within two months camera name speaker not working properly ####   Ok ####   Lenovo has been a name associated with quality. Even though the laptop looks and feels ergonomic ##   with spacious keypad and stress free trackpad ##  the experience is quite harrowing. The battery initially lasted for 5-7 hours even mild gaming or video watching. But within a month it has dropped down to hardly 2 hours. The lithium cell supposedly needs to hold the juice for at least a day with mild computing applications ##  which has never been the case. There are bloatware in the system draining the internet all the time apart from the normal windows 10 draining. I've been using ThinkPad series laptops for years ##  for all my process intensive applications ##  and very satisfied. Using less process  IdeaPad for normal user applications supposedly should have been a better experience. Alas ##  it's nothing better than dismal. If there was anyway to give zero or negative stars I definitely would have done that. ####   Too much satisfied with this laptop and vakue for money. I am using it from the last 3 month and till now no issue faced. Thanks to Amazon fast and safe delivery. ####   Most useless product. After antivirus McAfee expired it would not let me renew it - each time my funds were deducted from bank and then it would freeze. Now when I try to buy it again it starts deleting all my files.  Took it to service Center who directed me to amazon. Amazon is not able to resolve it and they are sending me back to the service centre.  I’m being shunted around and I’m so frustrated . Never buy this product from amazon as they don’t do returns when product does not work. Waste of my money and energy as the nearest service Center is 70km from Lavasa . Warranty taken by me is on-site instead Amazon has asked me to go back again to Lenovo Center. IMAGINE - full day job again ####   Its been only 3 months i brought this laptop and keypad of it is not functioning..Please dont buy this laptop..Worst laptop. ####   Great laptop...good battery life...can also handle  gaming...comfortable to carry ####   Battery quality Isn't up to mark ####   One of the best ####   Battery life is very poor. ####   I bought the model with 8Gb RAM and 256Gb SSD. ####   Camera is not so good ####   Company or amazon should cover guarantee and insurance. Overall till now working good. Though not used but till now good experience. ####   Good ####   Product was defective. The webcam was broken and we had to go through the whole process on following up about this complaint. Since it wasn't replaced we lost on the other deals that were available at that time too. ####    Update after 8 months usages: ####   Battery life is somehow good but not excellent.easily draining fastly ####   I liked the overall performance of the laptop!!! ####   - VE: ####   Good product ##  good quality ##  good looking. Adequately powered to handle day to day processing needs. MS Office student version bundled ##  helping in handling school work. ####   Microphone is not working. ####   Good package with ssd ##  i3 10 gen ##  win 10 and ms office in this price range. ####   Very light and handy. Zip unzip is not provided with windows ####   Excellent I never seen like seen .mind blowing ####   looks : sleek and easy to handle and light weight ####   Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3i Review ####   While the laptop is a good buy ##  some of the keys are interchanged on the keyboard. I've called the customer care numerous times to help sort the issue out - either by troubleshooting on call or by completely replacing the item. But haven't been able to. And now we're past the replacement timeline and I'm stuck with a laptop that says @ by typing the apostrophe key ##  instead of 2 key. ####   Keypad pad issue ####   Battery life cannot be judged as this soon. Camera quality is enough for our need. We used for online classes only. It's too thin than we expected. Looking elegant. Msoffice is not working. ####   Bought this laptop on June 14th. It has not been working from beginning of August. Started giving trouble in a month's time. Switches off by itself. Very unhappy with it. ####   I bought this laptop for work from home during lockdown and it turned out to be a really big pain for me instead. ####   Pros: light weight ##  blazing fast due to 8GB ram and 256 GB SSD ##  included MS office ####   Hard disc is very lower than shown ####   Buying this device on prime day was the best deal with 1.5k additional card discount. ####   If you want it for attending webinars then it is good ##  ####   Camera could be HD type at least since it's a laptop with 8Gb memory and i3 ##  10th Generation intel processor? Its poor vga type. Rest everything is acceptable. Value for money when you buy in discount of 34.5k. ####   1.

Thank you ####   I would recommend this laptop to anyone who is looking for casual usage or for coding or for day to day use. ####   The starting time is very fast because of 256GB SSD. I'm really satisfied with it.  Truly amazing. ####   I got a defective product. The camera was not working ##  raised a complaint and the next day HP Engineer came and examined that theres issue with Motherboard. Raised replacement request ##  got response from amazon that product wwas out of stock and agreed to refund. Called them 4-5 times and everytimes they said we will raised refund request this time. For the last time I told them if this time my refund was not initiated then I will escalate this matter to Consumer court and amazon zonal head ##  next day they send person to pick the laptop and the refund will be reflected in the statement of my card. Not expected from amazon such service.... ####   Like- Speed ####   Good Quality Laptop... ####   All over good ####   good for mid-range gaming laptop ####   Lags sometimes. Not totally satisfied with the performance. Although it is a very good choice at this price range. ####    As per the Amazon this laptop has AMD RADEON vega 6 but this laptop has only  AMD Radeon vega 3 . ####   Never buy HP products because their technical team has 0 knowledge about their products and they always give stupid reasons .......... Also they transfer call to one another saying they will solve but you will never get solution... not only this they will say you about call back which you will never get and at last they themself say why did you buy the hp product... ####   Dis like because battery backup is  too weak. ####   Disappointed . don't buy this item plz ####   Fantastic purchase for online classes ####   OK but slow down ram function ####   LAPTOP SCREEN GOES OFF SUDDENLY AND NOT COMING BACK ##  LED LIGHTS ARE ON SYSTEM IS ON BUT SCREEN NOT COMING BACK ####   Product delivered within time ## and the laptop is looking very nice. ####   Very very slow ####   Good. Done job ####   Reviewed it after 10 days of usage. Had to buy a laptop so that my daughter can do her online classes that were 3hrs long. Surveyed a lot and finally bought this. After the initial setup of windows and all ##  I had shutdown and booted the system again. Within 5-6 seconds after pressing the power button ##  login screen came up. This is the fastest boot I have ever seen on a laptop. 1TB drive is dedicatedly for storage. 256gb SSD drive is only for the OS ##  which is good. Due to SSD ##  laptop boot time is lightening fast. Laptop is not heavy and looks real slim. Just for it. ####   The HP laptop is very nice ##  the look is very stylish.. i have given surprise gift to my wife and she liked a lot... ####   Good ####   Nice product ####   Looks wise good. Performance is Average . Lacks while attending online class. ####   Laptop and Charger is not working. ####   speed is very good. ####   It's nice to usage ####   It is very nice product. Suite better for students not for Gamer and heavy buisness usage ####   Nice performance ####   Look is good. But hangs frequently. My usage is minimal with some browsing and online classes. ####   All are is good but only camera is bad others is good. ####    Office and personal sometimes gaming ####   I like beautiful design and speed function of this laptop. ####   It's 23rd day of purchasing. It starts hang after 15 days but since it was hanged a little so I thought it could be network problem or so but gradually it starts hanging continuously despite good network or so. I haven't downloaded any movie ##  pictures ##  softwares etc but it is going to hang every time. Return window is also closed after 1 week only. It's my big mistake that I purchased this laptop for my son for taking online classes ####   The first issue faced is back light bleed. since its an urgent requirement ##  I did not have much more time to replace the item. so i dint replaced. and OK back light bleed is not a serious issue. you can check the same by searching dead pixel test in internet. when black colous will appear check whether there is any bleed. ####   Do not buy this  product  it waste of money. I brought it for my daughter classes with in a month it stop working. Stopped working after 1 month. This is totally waste of money ####    It's just amazing! Let me get the details here: ####   Excellent laptop with great specs in this price range. Should buy this if you are looking for budget laptop. ####   speaker and fan making noise time to time  ##  its also have heating problem  ##  i never suggest this product ####   The key board colour ####   Don't buy online HP laptops... buy it from store. ####   Laptop screen has while spot on it! I tried to book and actually book technician two times but technician didn't show up! ####   Good ####   Very good laptop value for money and best laptop In this price segment  the browsing and file copy is  really fast due to ssd drive after three months of use ####   I purchased this model by mistake but it comes out a good model. ####   This laptop is fast enough in this budget.battery could have been better. ####   I bought it for my online classes and some small stuffs ##  booting time only 8 secs. Wah so great. Screen is so good. You can do average multitasking ##  if you think about processor ##  you can go for other companies like asus lenovo. But HP is more durable in regards of hardware. This ryzen 3250 is dual core ##  don't get messed with this. If you want ryzen ##  just search for 4 cores ##  hope it will be more better. ####   The seller shipped ##  misplaced in transit before delivery and now neither seller nor Amazon is ready to provide resolution. Amazon has recently gone down in quality. This is the second time I have faced issues. ####    I don't Recommend Anyone to buy this product(I had brought This laptop for 39k now the price has gone to 43k) It is not worth 40K itself The Laptop failed in just 1-2 months.(I tried to contact HP but they said that it is a software issue and told me to update BIOS but still the same Problems) Build quality is very cheap ## In windows The display Started flickering and also applications like google meet ## Teams etc also started hanging.Youtube videos and audio breaks even though I have a fast internet connection.Laptop is very slow and frequently hangs.it also showed after 1 month that the cooling fan is not operating correctly.There are also dead Pixels around the screen.I DON'T RECOMMEND this product to anyone.Better go with Dell Or any other Brand And do not buy any Laptops from AMAZON.It is a Pure waste of Hard Earned Money ####   Very nice at this price ####   Ok. Use for online work.good speed. ####   It's a good laptop and the screen is big  ## bt the camera quality should be better ## just bought it n it's been only 4 days ####    Poor quality. I bought this laptop for my 10 yr old daughter to attend online classes. The laptop hangs after 10 mins into the meeting. I am not sure if it is MS teams issue or laptop but I am utterly disappointed. ####   Its been a month from purchasing this laptop ##  and it is working really well. Satisfied with it. ####   I am not very happy about it. Its battery gets exhausted in 2 hours very bad service of hp. never buy this laptop. ####   Satisfied by the product. Worth for money ####   Using it for online classes ##  normal day-to-day kids works. ####   Excellent product very smooth and faster. ####   The product is damage on screen ####   Perfect laptop for home use.. quick and easy to carry !! ####   Seller chiting with buyer ####   Best laptop in my life ####   Product is very nice with fast speed and awesome ####   Good speed ####   This laptop is a combination of ssd and hdd ####   Good condition. Runs faster. But you should refresh it for every 2 hours. For gaming purpose I don't know. For office work and running of software programs was good. But please prefer intel core processor. And it has battery in built which was not removable. ####   Very delicate ##  1 year use also very hard. Only looks only but not useful for long run at all. So think about it ####   Material used is plastic ##   removing from corner of display ####   Battery backup is very low."},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcer Swift X AMD Ryzen 5 5600U 14-inch (35.56cms) Premium Thin & Light Laptop- (16 GB/512 GB SSD/Win 10 Home/NVIDIA® GeForce® RTX 3050 with 4GB of GDDR6 Graphics/Safari Gold ##  1.39 KG ##  MSO) ##  SFX14-41G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹1 ## 09 ## 999.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹25 ## 009.00 (23%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": "₹84 ## 990.00", "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available* # Processor : AMD Ryzen 5 5600U hexa-core processor with max turbo up to 4.20 GHz | RAM : 16 GB of onboard LPDDR4X system memory # Display : 14.0\" display with IPS (In-Plane Switching) technology ##  Full HD 1920 x 1080 ##  high-brightness (300nits) Acer ComfyView LED-backlit TFT LCD ##  16:9 aspect ratio ##  color gamut sRGB 100% # Graphics : NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 with 4GB of GDDR6 VRAM | Storage : 512 GB ##  PCIe Gen3 8 Gb/s ##  NVMe SSD (upgradable up to 1 TB ) # OS : Windows 10 Home 64-bit | Battery life up to 14 hours |Weight : 1.37 Kg| Fingerprint reader # Ports : 1 x USB Type-C port with DC-in ##  1 x USB 3.2 Gen 1 port with power-off charging ##  1 x USB 2.0 port##", "no_of_rating": "3 ratings", "avg_rating": "3.4", "total_no_answer": null, "delivery_type": "FREE delivery:", "delivery_date": "EMI", "Model": "Swift X", "Brand": "Acer", "SpecificUses": "Multimedia, Personal, Business", "ScreenSize": "14 Inches", "OS": "Windows 10 Home", "more_detail": "\nBrand\n#\n‎Acer\n\n\nManufacturer\n#\n‎Acer, Compal Electronics Pvt Ltd, No.D01, Zone D, Air Port Section of LiangLu CunTan Free Trade Port Area, YuBei District, Chongqing, China\n\n\nSeries\n#\n‎Swift X\n\n\nColour\n#\n‎Gold\n\n\nForm Factor\n#\n‎Laptop\n\n\nItem Height\r\n\n#\n‎18 Millimeters\n\n\nItem Width\r\n\n#\n‎32.3 Centimeters\n\n\nStanding screen display size\n#\n‎14 Inches\n\n\nScreen Resolution\n#\n‎1920 x 1080 pixels\n\n\nResolution\n#\n‎1920 x 1080 Pixels\n\n\nProduct Dimensions\n#\n‎21.2 x 32.3 x 1.8 cm; 1.39 Kilograms\n\n\nBatteries\n#\n‎1 Lithium ion batteries required.

First MacBook Air for me and really awesome ####   Need a video on tips to fast install ####   Speed 5/5; display 5/5; audio 5/5 ####   Had a terrible experience with the new macbook air i bought from amazon. The new macbook air didn't boot just after 1st day. Amazon CX team didn't agree to replace the faulty product & apple's support didn't really come to any help. If any such fault comes up in the new macbook air that you buy ##  you will get really stuck & your money might get wasted. Add to this the frustration & wasted time. ####   Very worst product from apple. Don't buy at any cost. Display will get broken automatically. ####   This is the best laptop ever to buy . No words for how amazing this is. Think grant think apple . ####   Really fast and impossible to lag ####   Fast. ####   The best laptop I have ever used...period!!! ####   Great product ####   Overall experience is very good. Writing this review after usage of 15days. Look and feel are great. ####   I bought the laptop around 4 months back in the first month display had issues and now the keyboard apple charges a bomb but this kind of a quality from their product is not expected 2 repairs in 4 months ##  my half prices Lenovo laptop did not give me this much problem I will never buy apple products ever again I wasted 90k on this laptop thinking it would be good but I was wrong ##  2 times I had to get it repaired ##  what quality is this not expected from a brand like this it's the first and last time in my life I am buying any product of apple I asked them to replace it but the company denied as they only change parts not the laptop ##  I bought it thinking they replace the product in case of any issue but they don't it's their product that is faulty still they won't replace it just keep changing parts one after the other ####   So ##  i got macbook air 3 years back (2018) ####   Product delivered in good condition and a good deal for laptop exchanges ####   Better than expected ####   I took my 1st Apple Product i.e. MBA M1 this June 21 ##  and as usual I used it at night one day and when I opened it the next morning ##  it was dead ##  in just 2 months time. Finally it is repaired now since under warranty ##  but could have costed me 50 grands to get it repaired when out of warranty. Worst product ever. Never going to buy an APPLE product ever in my life. Never ever. I have used several laptops ##  but being dead in just 2 months is a new thing. A piece of advice ##  don't buy it ##  there are plenty of other good products in the market which will last long ##  at the least longer than 6 months. Didn't expect it from a brand like Apple. ####   Actually i am very much tensed after seeing the bad reviews but its awesome i had windows before mac is so much faster than that dell laptop that i had before i love it.🙂 ####    Value for money ####   Bought the apple macBook from amazon by exchanging old laptop. Being a first time apple product user i am simply enjoying my first macBook. Also i was a little hesitant for buying such an expensive laptop online but amazon did its job very well. ####   I love this machine. ####   Applied for replacement and customer care made it but delivery person didn't complete the replacement due to some technical issues ####   This is my second macbook air and like my previous macbook air 2017 this one made me go ga ga as well. I am very impressed with the battery back up and processing power of this machine. I had to buy a connector for various ports which is a pain as this version has only 3 ports. 2 USB-C on one side and a 3.5 mm audio jack on the other side. The display is awesome and clear. This version is a little heavier than 2017 Macbook air though. 256 GB sdd space was enough for me as I have external sdd and hdd where I store most of my data. The charger is different from the earlier Macbook Air 2017. Firstly there is no separate extension cable as was with 2017 Air. The charger is a USB -C charger and after connecting the charger only one USB -C port remains free for use which makes a connector must. The connector that I purchased had 2 male USB C ports on one side to connect and  2 USB - C female ##  2 USB - A female ##  MMC Card female and HDMI female port on other ends. The Air comes with MacOS Big Sur pre installed. ####   I am not a programmer or a graphic designer but I needed this for coursework and statistical analysis. The battery seems to be everlasting and I charge it once in 2 days and even that is super fast. The weight is light and the ergonomics is great. The MacBook interface is just great and you won’t regret this purchase. It took me a day to get used to it ##  being a previous Windows user but everyday I discover new hidden features and it’s great. Don’t buy it to show off but buy it for the absolute workhorse that it is. ####   Pros: ####    I got a diffective product with body bas problems. The laptop does not even sits properly on a surface ##  it's one side down ##  so frustrating. Honest suggestions to everyone ##  at least do not buy apple products from Amazon India ##  they just are selling diffective products - body defects ##  used products and even with system glitches. The best place to buy genuine and new apple products is at Apple India website. ####   Bro jo bhi le na bs aakh band kar k le lena pr apne mummy papa se puch kar hi lena vase toh bht hi bdiya laptop hai har spec. ####   I got in only at 82.5k with hdfc credit card ####   This is not the product which is expected from Apple ##  the apple executives say that the apple logo will glow but upon receiving its found that the apple Logo on back of screen do not glow. Now when i am trying to speak with them they are putting their hands up..... ####   Very fabulous Macbook Air m1 ####   if you are hard core programmer buy 16gb ram laptop ####   Okay so a few months ago I purchased the m1 macbook air base model and I can't believe how fast it is ##  when I compared it to the previous intel based macs this guy is leaps and bounds better than the Intel ##  if u have an Intel machine  ##  it wouldn't even be possible for u to edit photos but m1 in this mac handles even the most heavy graphically intensive edits and games and more  ##  if ur in a market for the best value for money and the best performance this is the laptop to get. ####   Pros: ####   Amazing product from apple - long battery life ##  lasts upto 8-9 hours easily. Never had encountered any hangs or frozen screens or apps. Overall experience has been outstanding.. must buy for all apple enthusiasts (like myself 😉) ####   Packing and delivery was good. I had exchanged it with MacBook Pro Mid 2012 model and compared to that model ##  this MacBook air is super light weight. This is the review based on just opening the package. ####   The new Macbook Air with Apple's M1 chip is a powerhouse for normal office use. Combined with its elegant looks ##  close integration with iOS ##  it's unmatched in its class. ####   Cons: ####   For doing study only. ####   Became dead after one week of proper functioning. Need to be taken to customer care and they took more than 20dayz to fix the issue. ####   Pro ####   M1 Processor from Apple makes it super fast to do multitasking ##  complex excel sheets ##  Zoom or Microsoft Teams with Video & execute programs. ####   Very good product ####   Only complain is about camera ##  it would have been better. ####   Sturdy great built doesn't heat no noise good battery ####   This laptop I've got it for 75k with HDFC offers ##  which is the best deal. Also ##  battery backup is simply amazing and with rest of the device am sure all by now know it has an awesome screen. However the only expectation is apple to quickly load apps customized to M1 into their store or atleast most used ones. Overall build quality is 10/10 ##  screen 10/10 ##  performance 10/10 ##  support 9/10 ##  battery 10/10 ##  sound quality 8/10 ##  value for money 9/10. ####   Almost everything that you could ask for. Just look out for software/applications which have not yet been ported to M1 chip. Especially if you're planning to run virtualization ##  data science/ML ecosystem ##  you might hit some blocks. ####   I was skeptical about the screen 13.3 inch 16:10 size but got used to it quickly. The battery do really lasts more than I expected. Its built very solid. The screen is phenomenal colorful good for photo editing  ## sharp ##  black text looks bit grey. M1 processor makes this laptop sorry macbook very fast . I would recommend to buy it. Through discounts and exchange offer i got base version at 77k. ####   Macbook suddenly stopped working after 2 weeks. It is not turning on. ####   Best value for money.. ####    This is the first time i encounter such problem in apple products as i am a big fan of apple products usually they are known for their product long life but macbook air with m1 chip is a big disaster. It is dead within 3 days. ####   Ordered the M1 Air on 5th August and got it delivered on the 7th. Then on 18th noticed a black/grey spot on the display... quick google search revealed this as a dead pixel and quite common with M1 Macs. So I called up Apple and they offered me two options ##  either a new replacement Mac or full refund since mine is still under 14 days. As soon as I revealed that I purchased from Amazon ##  the Apple sales team said sorry they can't help me since Amazon is not Apple authorised seller. ####   Love it. ####   I have received my MacBook Air with M1 chip on time. It was well packed to protect any physically damage during shipping. The product works as smooth as it was expected. ####   The best laptop I have ever used! I switched from windows to apple for the very first time. And it was worth it. This piece begs you to keep working! The most significant plus point is definitely battery life. I charged it on one Saturday night and with daily usage of nearly 1-2 hours of YouTube and coding ##  till next Sunday it was at 19%. Just mind-blowing! ####   Battery Life - Excellent ####   Remains cold even after extensive usage ####   Display is ultra-shiny & reflective ##  causes eyestrain. Onscreen print is not black but grey - & can't be changed - even harder to see.  Fast and lots of features but I'm sorry I bought this machine ##  it's not User Friendly ##  my old Mac was much nicer to use. ####   It is best device you can ever ask for ##  the sluggish behaviour of windows laptops is totally overwhelming by its speed and performance ####   My first Mac ##  so far had no issues ##  in 15 days hanged once for 15 secs during shutdown ##  else everything is good. Absolutely no noise and no heating. Battery backup average 9-10 hours for moderate usage (browsing ##  movie ##  youtube ##  streaming etc). If pocket permits then you can have this blindly without even attempt to comparing with other PC. ####   Got this mac air @ ₹ 83 ## 700 ####   This is my first MacBook. I am not a video editor or software professional. So can speak about the design and overall performance only. It’s good enough for my daily office works and browsing. Only thing I required was office tools like excel ##  word and PowerPoint ##  that was not there but I purchased office 365 and managed it. I think response time is pretty more comparing to my previous HP intel i5 10th gen. but overall it’s good looking and very handy. Battery life is excellent no words to say ##  similarly video clarity and sound is also awesome. Apple was dream for me and now I owned it. ####   First Macbook ever and I'm already loving it. ####   perfect laptop. ####   Performance / Battery is Great! ####   Smooth laptop which runs without any hickup and best part is the transition between apps or browsers which runs seamlessly.. and as claimed by the apple the batter runs min of 10hours on a single charge. But only cons is its nt dat light weight as I was expecting it to be. ####   Battery life is awesome.. feels so premium!! Got a great deal on Amazon! Nevert thought I would buy a apple laptop online! ####   Loved the colour. if you are fond of rose gold ##  I highly recommend this one. ####   It's a magical product from Apple. ####   Apple is not considered for value for money ##  but this laptop has the most value for money I've ever got. This is a ~1L laptop but it performs better than 2.5-3L laptops. Getting this on a deal is something you won't repent in the next 5-6 years. ####   Love it. Would have been happy all the useful software like office etc. were bundled with the Mac. One need to purchase  ##  a hassle. ####   Excellent machine! The battery life is better than your mobile phone 8hrs on heavy usage 12hrs on medium and more on just light usage. ####   This is awesome item. ####   It's cracked and when i first time i turn on it  coming lines on screen  amazon worst coming in world ####   Amazing macbook. I loved it. ####   I purchased it from the online Apple Store with a student discount and got it in 83K and got free Airpods 2 worth 15K free. ####   Great product from apple!! Got delivered a day before..

Very fast boot due to SSD drive.With 8gb memory all applications are running smoothly. Not so good for gaming purpose. Sound quality is acceptable but not loud enough. Battery performance is ok. Useful for regular office works and for students. Overall finish is good. But all ports are on the right side which I dislike.It's weight is suitable for easy carrying. Remember that pre loaded McAffe and Office are valid for only one month. ####   Good for a person who has to receive and send personal emails ##  chat on Skype and surf the internet. Very nice feel of keys. I have been recommended by my children to have external ssd to store photos and videos and retain only the program files on the laptop for optimum efficiency in the long run; which I will do. ####   This one is just right for those who are looking day to day work such as making presentations ##  conducting meeting ##  browsing social media. ####    I purchased the laptop from Amazon on 6th september with preinstalled windows 10 OS and MS office. It got deliverd on 14th Sept. The laptop has issues like the toolbar at the bottom doesnt work ##  search doesnt work ##  windows button on the screen doesnt work ##  windows key doesnt work. Amazon doesnt allow to contact them for any query. I am genuinly disappointed with Amazon and this HP product. I have wasted 2 whole days try to chase Amazon and HP support but its of no use. Now the HP guys are saying that I have to reinstall the windows OS on the system. For that I have to purchase a pendrive from them which costs INR 1000/-. Sadly nothing helps even if the product is new and is in warranty. Because clearly HP and Amazon will not help. ####   - Build quality is bad. Cheapest quality plastic used ##  laptop flexes ##  makes creaking sound every where. ####   Nice lapto of HO brand. Quality name itself proves a lot. Every thing is good As such.... ####   Performance / speed is very good. ####   Don't buy this laptop I got my replacement product but same proble is showing. ####   Found Start up problem ####   It's not even a week now the laptop is not working properly and automatically typing ##  customer care not working ####   Product is good but purchase it on Amazon is bad. Amazon services are very poor.I received faulty piece and after raising ticket with Amazon higher management ##  nobody is bothering to resolve my complaint. I think ##  Flipkart services are better than Amazon and need to go for it .. ####   Laptop is light weight and works on good speed. Full HD screen is excellent. Recommended for basic work. ####   only ight games are supposed to be downloaded on this laptop ####   smooth working ####   No ####   It's been just a week or so ##  so far no problem ##  works like a champ. ####   Though this is too early to comment ##  but the first look and usage experience is perfect. ####   I purchased this laptop for my daughter’s online classes and overall what I have observed…the laptop is good for day to day classes or for moderate office work ####   My sister uses this laptop for her online classes and I should say that till now I have not faced any issues. The laptop takes only 8-10 seconds to boot up due to SSD and this laptop also comes with an Intel 11th gen core i3 processor and a TPM 2.0 module. So this laptop will support Windows 11 for sure. I can confirm that because I testsed it with Microsoft's own PC Health Check App. So overall at around at around ₹40k this laptop serves it's purpose well. ####   Excellent product. Very thin nice color. Screen brightness is very good. Very fast. Just 8-10 seconds for login screen. Speakers are also good. ####   Screen Quality is less than average ####   Liked: ####   easy to handle and speed is good because of ssd overall it's OK OK type laptop u can use it for general things ####   I liked the gaming experience i played minecraft and free fire it dont lag on ultra 😎 ####   It’s a very very fast laptop and good display.takes 4sec to boot.Till now found no issues and everything is top class ####   Super design and good quality ####   Defective product delivered ####   Genuine product and affordable ####   Good quality ####   Never Buys HP products because their technical team has 0 knowledge about their products and they always give stupid reasons .......... Also they transfer call to one another saying they will solve but you will never get solution... not only this they will say you about call back which you will never get and at last they themself say why did you buy the hp product... ####   Just started system. It's getting over heated. Fan is making lot of noise. ####   Loving every bit of it. I don't use it for gaming or any other high graphic and RAM uses ##  just normal usage and it works like a charm and not to mention the light weight. Go for it without second thoughts...!! 🙂 ####   This is my first laptop ##  and am very much satisfied with it. ####   Laptop stopped working after appx 15days ##   Seems faulty product has been delivered or quality is such like that it only will work until the period you can request replacement. Now I have to keep chasing HP Service Center to get this repaired ####   Great purchase! ####   With ssd hard disk ##  it works really fast and it is more than sufficient for my daily routine. Reasonable price with good quality and speed ####   Best laptop for coding and video editing. I've personally used this for web development ##  salesforce and video editing and battery last long for 3-4 hours...best purchase🔥 ####   I like this laptop very much. It is portable.It is light .It is good for programming and simple works. It has a good battery.I used to play some games on this and this is working properly.It is best for a student. ####   I bought it a month ago!! From past 2 days it is giving the below error. Tried contacting HP support but no resolution yet. ####   Pros: ####   bought this laptop last week ##  I'm very satisfied with its performance and built quality. don't underestimate its performance by its processor ##  i3 11th Gen ##  it is way better than the old i5 processors ##  superfast with its turbo boost technology ##  up to 4.1Hhz. and it bundles with SSD and 8GB of ram ##  which gives extra performance to this laptop. the sound quality is ok ##  not extraordinary ##  comes with 720p decent webcam ##  which is enough for your online meetings and all. the keyboard is good for touch-typing. boots up in less than 5 seconds. battery backup is ok ##  easily getting 7-8 hours of continuous usage. the laptop is very thin and lightweight ##  so it is very easy to carry around. the touchpad is little small ##  that's the only con I noticed ##  and the display doesn't have an anti-glare coating ##  but it's not a major issue in indoor conditions ##  the diaplay panel is bright enough to overcome this. ####   Stopped working less than 2 months after purchase. Had to be checked in to a service centre and a part replaced. Not what you would expect when you buy a new laptop of a reputed make. ####   Its been only 10 days that I got my delivery and the laptop started hanging and when I was using it for the third time and it got shut down 5 times in just two hours. ####   Good configuration ##  performs well overall. ####   Just go for this product.  After months of research I have selected this considering all the pros. Best for daily use with regular stuffs ##  not for hardcore gaming or programming. Though this laptop can handle it well. ####   Worth for the money.. fulfill its purpose.. ####   The Laptop is quite ok (i.e screen display ##  light weight ##  startup device ##  etc). The delivery was also fast but the charger is heating too fast. ####   Online class perspective it's good. ####   I am really expressed with the performance and speed. It starts and shut down in few seconds. Only the keyboard is not upto the mark. It gives feeling like a local keypad. ####   Great performance ####   It's good for performing ####   Okay ##  in the process ####   Good ####   Just wow ####   great product ####   nice one ####   Excellent product for this price range ####    Features are good but quality is very cheap and fittings are also uneven and loose. beeter to spens 5k more for quality or go for cheap laptop atleast you get value for money. ####   Overall average ####   Using this since last two weeks ##   awesome performance ####   I like the laptop and it's pretty impressive. ####   Worst battery backup ####   Easy set up ##  free life time validity of MS office 2019 and a very responsive laptop. All that’s needed for personal computer. Good one. ####   Problem is with warranty. Laptop was purchased on July 21 but activated in the month of may. ####   Decent configured laptop that suits best for the initial level programmers and students project activities. Boot time was really fast and performance is good as expected. ####   Superb ####   Camera is not very good. Problem in connection with wifi once connection goes out. It only comes with hotspot. I think HO should look into this problem ####   I love hp product...! ####   It has all the features which I wanted to have. The most unexpected feature is that is light weight. At this price ##  it's a good laptop. ####   Superb ####   For basic use ##  Its good. Prices should be little lesser. Biggest advantage is small size and light weight. ####   Every time getting g the same error ####   Slightly expensive ####   While my experience with the laptop has been good and no issues noticed in terms of performance or battery at this price. ####   Took 10 days to deliver this awesome product .  Best build quality. Very light . Easy to Rome with handy lappy . Overall all value for money . ####   Nice value for money... ####   Worst battery performance. Daily I am refilling the battery for 6 - 7 times. And if laptop is in sleep mode...if after one hour I resume the from sleep mode...the battery percentage increased by 3%. ####   Excellent ##  trendy ##  smooth performance ####   Product came faulty with battery issue ##  requested for replacement order on 27th July 2021 ##  was showing delivery date of 3rd August ##  (For prime Members – 2 Days Deliver?) ##  But till date 3rd August ##  order has not been delivered ##  nor there is any update status on my order. ####   Didn't even worked for a day.  It was dead. ####   HPs reliability and Intel11s performance a good combo👍 ####   Warranty is showing for 9 months only...no support from amzaon ####   the screen is good and the size of the laptop is perfect too. i dont really see why did i even think of trading this laptop for an asus laptops coz the screen is just awesome. i did a lot of overthinking before getting this one whether the processor speed would be enough and everything and i am happy with this one for sure. And this laptop isnt an anti glare one which makes it so much better viewing experience. i am not regretting one bit after getting this. ####   Amazing product. We liked all the features of the product. ####   Product  is  awesome  brought  for  my son after  a  lot of  confusion  among  which  to choose"},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDell Inspiron 7415 14 inch FHD Touch Display 2in1 Laptop (R5 5500U / 8GB / 512GB SSD / Integrated Graphics / Win 10 + MSO / Backlit KB + FPR + Active Pen /Pebble Metal Color) D560470WIN9P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹88 ## 627.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹18 ## 637.00 (21%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": "₹69 ## 990.00", "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available.

Got stuck 2 times while doing simple tasks. ####   Don't buy. Comes with serious display issues ##  could no be resolved by dell or Microsoft. Worst image quality. Used it for 15 days and found the issue. Contacted dell and Microsoft ##  experts have suggested almost all troubleshooting steps upto the clean installation of windows ##  but the issue could not be resolved. ####   Beautiful product ##  works wonders. S pen results in ease of doing work. Fully folding n touch works smoothly. ####   You need to get a screen protection to avoid scratches while writting. ####   Pros: Hinge is perfect ##  battery backup is fine. Pen is pressure sensitive. ####   Dislike ####   Excellent build ####   Good and quality experience. The camera quality could be improved. Dell service is commendable ####   Camera quality. Not Good ####   I contacted dell for a 2-year warranty extension ##  they asked for Rs 7500 for the basic warranty. I pointed out that dell often sells it for Rs1499 ##  they said it's an offer that does not apply when you purchase the laptop from amazon. ####   Display issue ####    Agreed it has got poweful ryzen 5000 series. And ram upgradability. And greater build quality and premium. ####   So far the product looks very nice and as mentioned in product description all are received in good condition ##   touch screen is well responsive ##   screen resolution is FHD and satisfactory. Speaker sound is clear and crystal ##  am very much satisfied. Overall a very good package product with desent specification and can be used for all purpose.  Silver tone colour is so fascinating am loving it. Waiting people can go for it ##   no wory. ####   Reviewing after 3days of use: (I'm a freelance software developer and a startup founder- using this lap for development and customer support prospects) ####   This in continuation the previous review I posted about this product. ####   this laptop beat in the segment the screen quality is very good ####   This review is specifically against the exchange system. I ordered this Inspiron laptop from Amazon primarily for the good exchange offer on my old i3 laptop. The image attached is of the laptop to be exchanged. I read the terms and conditions that clearly stated that the laptop should  BOOT and NOT have any issues with Screen. However the delivery person went on to check the entirety of the old laptop including the keyboard ##  mouse and even shaked it vigorously for issues!!! So far so good. Now they find some small plastic has chipped out of the SD Card reader and rejects the entire laptop. When I said it's not acceptable as such a stringent criteria was not there in the Terms and Conditions he put me across to his Supervisor.  I protested stating that being an old laptop used and abused for years it is practically impossible to have it in pristine condition all around. The Terms and Conditions also spoke only about the key things like Battery ##  Bootable disk and Screen which were all fine in my case. I even suggested that they can deduct small amount for the plastic casing deformity. The Supervisor cooly advised me to pay the FULL BALANCE and keep the old laptop myself. Needless to state I was upset and refused to accept this type of dubious exchange scheme's and asked them to take back the new laptop. ####   Disappointing laptop. Has started hanging- it’s been 3 times in less than 2 weeks of purchase. And no heavy duty usage at all. Camera quality not good- images appear yellowish. Audio quality is average. ####   Please buy from a dell store  ##  do not fall for Rs. 1000 2000 cheaper ones . Mine started to stop charging on 6 th day   ##  amazon guys have taken it up for replacement  ##  but still the experience alltogether isn't  worth the price + the unconditional warranty thats also missing . Kudos to team amazon though for an apt timely response . ####   Item didn't switch ON on receipt. Took much struggling to get back paid money. Disappointed from seller ##  delivery and amazon. ####   Excellent performance ####   Build quality is good as well as the performance. ####   I received a broken laptop. Which o opened n my finger started eefinb. My nerves started psinknb ####   Pros: Trackpad ##  smooth and fast ##  Battery ####   For the ones who face the hanging issue ##  my personal suggestion is to reset it once ##  it will be absolutely perfect afterwards. ####   Frend camera is not available ####   Its the latest model laptop suitable for professional use. It also looks good and very flexible. ####   Pathetic camera 0.9 MP and touchpad also hanging frequently ##  You need to restart every time. Avoid this laptop if you can. ####   Good laptop for daily work and programming. Strong built and display. ####   Best in the price range ##  combines power ##  touch and utility in single package. Screen is very good ##  getting 10hrs of battery life ##  touch is very sensitive and active pen is icing on the cake.

The laptop's performance is OK. But worth it at the price. ####   Looks = 4 star ####   Perfect for a  professional ####   Do not buy this product. RAM is not upgradabale which should be a dealbreaker as only 8 GB is not sufficient anymore. The RAM is soldered on the motherboard. ####   Excellent  ##  could be a bit cheaper a bit though. Great battery life and Ryzen 4800u is excellent and very fast. DDR4X 4266 is used so don't compare it with 3200 or lower RAM even if it is 16gb. Make sure you write to Lenovo to start 3 year onsite warranty for date of invoice  ##  default is from date of manufacturing. NVME speed good too ##  speakers are good but sound levels a bit low. USB type C charger good in this range. ####   Battery life is good performance is also decent. ####   I wish if I could undo my decision of buying this laptop... ####   The look and feel is awesome. ####   So  ##  i purchased this slim 7 14 amd  ##  from offline retailer  ##  If you are looking for bang for the buck and are on a hunt to get a pc  ##  then below mentioned features are good about this - ####   The best laptop I've ever used. Feel is very pleasant - didn't get that even when working on a macbook. ####   Worst laptop from Lenovo- ####   This is definitely a good laptop. I bought it after ages and ages of comparisons. To me out seems great value for money ####   Great machine for daily use. I use this for office purpose. It works good with all my usual applications (MS Office ##  Outlook ##  MSP ##  CAD ##  Coreldraw ##  Photoshop ##  Sketchup etc....) ####   battery life is good almost 8 hrs ####   This laptop is wow. ####   Liked the dimension and weight. I use for heavy programming ##  teaching and entertainment. ####   Likes: ####   One of the best Ryzen ultrabook for the CPU but these companies know how to give garbage to indian customers. 8Gb RAM for the best ryzen 7 cpu? like seriously.. the target customers for this product is mostly business and productivity use and 8 gb ram these days are a base smartphone standard. On top of it ##  there is no upgradable ram option and you are committed to 8gb ram for life if you purchase this. Other countries has 16gb ram option for the same Slim 7 model and for a price way lesser than what they are selling here. ####   Build quality is amazing. Feels premium in hand. Looks premium as well. I sawsome reviews online and they all complained about the glossy screen.but the unit I got had matte screen. Talking of screen. It's very good.covers almost 100% srgb color gamut. Can be used for professional color related work. Battery lifegood. Especially paired with the lenovo vantage software whichis really useful. Keyboard is good. The face recognition is spot on. Works even in the dark. Haven't tried it in pitch black yet. Now let's talk about performance. The ryzen 7 4800u is a beqst of a mobile processor. But it's a Shame this usnit is shipped with only 8 gigabyte of ram. Basically making the overpowered cpu useless in some memory intensive tasks. You can edit videos on this as well. But that 8 gb ram really ruins the experience. Really wish it was upgradable. Or at least 16 gb. But anyways ## the SSD is fast and reliable. And also i've heard that you can install a second ssd in ryzen version. Haven't checked myself whether this unit is upgradable or not but if running into storage problems you can always use external storage solutions. You won't feel the difference if you went with the ryzen 5 version of this laptop ##  which i guess isn't available on Amazon but it might be in the market. The price online of this unit is fine ##  not overpriced but i think if you buy offline you'll have more options to look for cuz this laptop has aome other versions as well. And if you are thinking of buying this you can it really has no major problems except that little 8gb ram. But you may also consider the hp envy x360. It has ryzen 5 with non upgradable 8 gb ram. Which i guess would be better for 8 gb. Cuz your 8gb ram will limit the performance in heavy tasks. ####   Pros: ####   Been using for almost a month as my work laptop. ####   This Slim 7 with Ryzen 7 4800U - 8c/16T has been in other markets for so loong. Now when its finally available Lenovo puts just 8G basically making that i7 shaming 4800u basically useless. ####   It's full fill my need; the only complaint is RAM is not upgradable. ####   Unbilivable product at unbilivable price. I got more powerful product with higher CPU and GPU at lower price. Go for it.... ####   Best product and high performance. ####   Giving it a 4 star ##  as the CPU/APU and NVMe hardware is awesome for the price. ####   I wanted a new laptop for myself. My requirements were that it is lightweight and fast performance. Bought this laptop after quite some research. The laptop is very light and can be carried around easily. It has a Ryzen 7 Lastest Gen processor which is super duper fast. Booting takes less than 10 secs and with the IR camera ##  you are on the home screen in next to no time. The laptop has a very classy feel with an all metallic body. The display is awesome with good brightness and great viewing angles. The laptop also has front facing speakers so it's great for entertainment. All in all ##  it's been a great buy and I am very happy with the purchase. ####   Amazing product. Always been a fan of the yoga brand and this model is the epitome of it. Fast and thin and light. Great build quality and the Ryzen 7 processor is lightning speed fast."},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS VivoBook 15 (2020) ##  39.6 cm HD ##  Dual Core Intel Celeron N4020 ##  Thin and Light Laptop (4GB RAM/256GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 10 Home/Transparent Silver/1.8 Kg) ##  X515MA-BR002T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹30 ## 990.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹6 ## 000.00 (19%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available.

It was two hitting and also battery adopter was hitting.  .😐 ####   I have used this laptop for almost a week now.I found many pro's as well as cons while using this laptop.First the pros..I tested many games like Assassin's Creed Valhalla ## Watch Dogs 2 ## Destiny 2.No problem whatsoever while gaming.Really good fps in older games like Destiny 2 and Watch Dogs 2 ## and decent fps in newer titles like AC Valhalla.Some setting tweak and it is possible to get almost 60 fps in Valhalla.The 144hz screen is really great ## everything feels smooth tho i wont use it cause the screen is too small.I connected the laptop using hdmi to a monitor.The rgb keyboard is a nice touch.Overall it does what it is good at i.e ## gaming. ####   Overall in short best buy laptop If your budget goes upto 65k then must try to stretch it a little more to go for Ryzen 7 4800 with 3050 instead of inteli5 or i7 This is good but still has issues with thermals Could be better with thermals and air ventilation outputs GTX 1650ti runs almost all games but CPU Temp rises above 90 very easily within few minutes of gameplay GPU is supportive and enough powerful to run almost all games Looks wise very nice and build quality metal top one is best in choice. Would highly recommend the same with ryzen 7 4800 and this one too if budget is upto 60k Grey colur metallic top looks dope. Must use a laptop stand with fans while running on turbo mode Armory crate in asus is amazing for switching in between performance silent and turbo as per uses. ####   Really good ####   Love it... ####   The laptop have honeycomb desing so the dust stick on the laptop ####   It’s sickkkk like Any other budget gaming laptop everything goooood except honestly think could’ve added a better processor cause sometimes it feels like it’s not enough for the 144hz but honestly its goood buy ittt ####   Battery backup is good  for office use. ####   The most disappointing thing about this laptop is it's display. For gaming it's good. You can play most of the game with no lags. ####   Initial Impressions: ####   Coming with a decently equipped hardware ##  the specs on this laptop are a treat for those who are buying this as their first gaming laptop. A GTX 1650 Ti ##  not the best ##  but enough to still run most AAA titles at medium 1080p ##  paired along with a intel 4-core power-hog. This kind of specs do come at a price though. The thermals of this thing are heavily compromised. The CPU easily reaches 95°C even under medium-heavy loads. So if you sit nearby an AC ##  you should be fine. And thanks to intel you cannot Undervolt the CPU. The only thing you can do to run the CPU under 90 degrees is to limit the TDP using any 3rd-party software or limit the Turbo Freq. within windows power settings. ####   Best display ##  build quality also good and performance is amazing. ####   It is a very good laptop for gaming ang productive work like online office or classes. It's battery life is very good when ur not playing any games but when playing playing games the battery will drain in an hour or so.overall I played Minecraft ## fortnite and GTA V the fps are good and the laptop does not heat at all. It's SSD is also very fast so it makes the experience much better. I overall this is the best laptop I have ever seen in this price range. ####    Awesome product ####   Not camera high quality Very low and performance cpu ram is good average ####   Best in segment at this price range. ####    It's a value for money deal. Great for gaming with different software adaptation modes. Super responsive screen 144Hz ##  RGB keyboard and the software is too good. For browsing and online classes ##  the battery may last upto more than 3½-5 hours on full charge. No heating issues. Upgradable SSD and HDD along with the RAM is a bonus. ####   Screen was defective product  corners of screen is not fixed correctly and got some yellow light. and the worst delivery experience they thrown the laptop box in complete bottom of all item and laptop box came loose box inside laptop has no safety than this laptop is crazy awesome I can suggest it every one . ####   best budget gaming laptop ####   Great laptop with GTX 1650ti ####   Very fast boot up . Good for working and games . ####   Best product ####   Quality is Good speakers are not that good..... AND GAMING BEAST 🔥 ####   I review it after a month  ##  performance is great there is no lags in display the built  quality is also superb you never feel it's plastic body ##  it ## s like a metal which is good. but I not get ms office 365 for life time it was installed in but for only trial ##  where I think they cheat in this category. So all the performance and quality is good you can buy without hesitation. If you not prefer their trail versions. ####   I just bought this product on Aug 26 and today being sept 6 laptop will not charge.  Return policy was valid till sept 3 it is either seller (Appario) provided a defective product or product itself is defective. I will try calling seller to fix or will be taking a legal action in court. ####   gaming experience was nice ####   Battery backup is not as expected  but overall it's really good one ####   Great computing machine with an amazing price. ####   Speed and performance top notch ####    Display have tint issue ##  first product I exchange because of this ## then I got with more tint issue ## the laptop is a good one ## bt don't buy from this sellers ####   Don't think twice just buy it !! ####    Awesome laptop for multitasking in this price range RGB keyboard is awesome and it takes around 4-5 secs to boot all because of SSD I believe and also there are no heating issues found battery lasts around 3hrs if we continuosly listen online classes it can be upgraded to Win 11  The only thing disappointed me is this variant is without MS office activated  camera quality is very good I expected a more battery life but as it is a gaming laptop the battery backup is ok and thanks to honeycomb design it really helps in heat dissipation as mentioned it meets military standards and when in charging turbo mode is activated which helps a lot only one small suggestion plz keep refresh rate @144Hz so that you will not face any screen blank issue for 2-3 secs when you connect or disconnect power source. I recommend this laptop to everyone who really wants to achieve something in their life and hidden features like MYAsus are add on for this laptop. I liked the RGB keyboard and the stickers provided in the box. ####    Awesome ####    Good laptop under 65k ####   awessome ####   Laptop is best for this price range but screen blinding is very high ####    For all those tuf gamers. Those who dare ####   I'm happy with this buy for around 64K (before card discount). The build quality is good ##  the screen at 144Hz is more than suitable for gaming. Battery isn't much of an issue for me ##  but the backup does seem to be on the low side. ####   Asus tuf f15 1650 ti model ####   Best gaming laptop ####   I had recently purchased the laptop ##  as a whole the laptop is amazing but the screen seems to be flickering. ####   Best laptop and work simultaneously gaming and any work and all over Best Quality Best price and screen good quality body 👌👍 ####   Buy it without any second thought for gaming. Best laptop in this price range but there is battery issue. ####   Decent features for this price range ####    Not workimg ####    like this asus tuf f15 gaming lap ####   The battery backup is good. ####   Got is crash and black screen error 😫 on initial system bootup ####   Like ####   Overall the laptop is superb for everything but the problem is that it don't come with the microsoft 365  ##  but it show that it is included. This is the bad for me that why they show that it is included. ####   Guys After i received my laptop i checked screen bleeding test. Very high screen bleeding. Guys be alert. Check your laptop ASAP after receiving. I called Amazon and opted for replacement. They said they'll in 24-48 hr. So let's see what would they do. Be alert Heavy screen bleeding🚨🚨🚨 ####   Good design ##  better finishing ##  smooth running ##  average 3½hr for normal usage and 1 hour for Gaming.. ####    ASUS gaming laptop..a worst choice.. we purchased one.. screen is blurred lights from corners.. if you put AC DC Adapter the screen will off for few seconds..when we contacted Amazon for replacement.. they simply say that contact Manufacturers.. Please don't buy expensive items such as laptops from Amazon..\"limited liability - simply says 7 days replacement or refund but nothing.. Amazon thieves.. ####   Good for work and gaming 👍  reviews after 2months of usage. Battery life is also good. Mostly used for work and sometimes gaming. Play almost all games with high fps. boot time is almost 5-8sec. Overall best and fast product. ####   Excellent Laptop ####   Snappy and responsive. A great buy. ####   Everything is good in this laptop ..every single features is just wow but wo bat hai na achi chiz me ek burai rhegi wo hai battery life(very poor)..It is written that battery life is 7hrs(mazak hai kya😆)..Hardly 4hrs in normal usage and watching flims you can get upto max 5hrs ####   Great product ####   This laptop is great for its price ##  it is the best gaming laptop for this price but if you are going to use thisfor gaming you need to turn off battery boost from nvidia geforce because the fps gets capped at 30 ####    Laptop is awesome 😎 ##  sleaky design attracts everyone and the sharp edges makes it much more pretty and brush finish at keyboard and all over the body makes it look rich. ####    Why u gave me useless product ##  ##  ## .....I ordered 9th aug. and delivered 13 th aug bt after 7 days(20th aug  )  ...and toady 21st aug. when replacement period has over ....I opened laptop nd suddenly show horizontal line on laptop .... what the hell is this man ####   Very good performance ####   Best Laptop for Programming. ####    Best Display :-Fhd at 144hz is just a eye candy..Anti glare coating does not strain the eyes neither gives headache...its super smooth cuz of 144hz..but not for video editing or content creation because of its 45% ntsc color panel ##  ####   I didn't use this for a long time but I'll write a review anyway. ####    Best labtob in in this prize I got this Amazon sale ####   Using for design work and experiencing good response of hardware. ####   Gaming performance is awesome.. smooth screen ...144hz..i had tested Rdr2 in it...i get 35 fps avg in ultra settings.. overall its a value for money product. ####   I got this beauty 2 days ago. Packaging and delivery was good ##  no issue there. ####   The whole support is also not good. ####   It only can handle for mostly  for two hours ####   I like performance ##  battery backup is abt 2 hrs ..abt value  for  money i would like to rate it as 4 out of 5 ####    The laptop is simply a beast the only con I find is that the webcam could have been slightly better else the specifications is just amazing. ####   Best Buy Good Configuration Strongly recommend ####   Super product but package was very WORST ####   If you need performance  ##  go for it!"},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLenovo Yoga Slim 7 AMD Ryzen 7 4800U 14\" (35.56cms) Full HD IPS Thin and Light Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Windows 10/MS Office 2019/Integrated AMD Radeon Graphics/Slate Grey/1.33Kg) ##  82A2008VIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹1 ## 06 ## 290.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹31 ## 290.00 (29%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": "₹75 ## 000.00", "about": "#Processor: 4th Gen AMD Ryzen 7 4800U | Speed: 1.8 GHz (Base) - 4.2 GHz (Max) | 8 Cores | 8MB Cache # OS: Pre-Loaded Windows 10 Home with Lifetime Validity # Pre-Installed: MS Office Home and Student 2019 # Memory and Storage: 8GB RAM LPDDR4X-4266 | 512 GB SSD # Graphics: Integrated AMD Radeon Graphics # Display: 14\" Full HD (1920x1080) | Brightness: 300nits | Anti-Glare | IPS Technology | 100% sRGB # Design: 1.51 cm Thin and 1.33 kg Light | Aluminium Case | Narrow Bezel##", "no_of_rating": "67 ratings", "avg_rating": "4.5", "total_no_answer": "\n73 answered questions\n", "delivery_type": "₹99.00 delivery:", "delivery_date": "EMI", "Model": "Yoga Slim 7", "Brand": "Lenovo", "SpecificUses": "Personal, Business", "ScreenSize": "14 Inches", "OS": "Windows 10 Home", "more_detail": "\nBrand\n#\n‎Lenovo\n\n\nManufacturer\n#\n‎Lenovo, One of the below: Hefei Bitland Information Technology Co.,Ltd - No.4088 Jiuxiu Road National Hefei economic & technology development area Hefei Anhui China LCFC（Hefei) Electronics Technology Co., Ltd. - NO.1-3188,YUNGU ROAD, HEFEI EXPORT PROCESSING ZONE.

The laptop's performance is OK. But worth it at the price. ####   Looks = 4 star ####   Perfect for a  professional ####   Do not buy this product. RAM is not upgradabale which should be a dealbreaker as only 8 GB is not sufficient anymore. The RAM is soldered on the motherboard. ####   Excellent  ##  could be a bit cheaper a bit though. Great battery life and Ryzen 4800u is excellent and very fast. DDR4X 4266 is used so don't compare it with 3200 or lower RAM even if it is 16gb. Make sure you write to Lenovo to start 3 year onsite warranty for date of invoice  ##  default is from date of manufacturing. NVME speed good too ##  speakers are good but sound levels a bit low. USB type C charger good in this range. ####   Battery life is good performance is also decent. ####   I wish if I could undo my decision of buying this laptop... ####   The look and feel is awesome. ####   So  ##  i purchased this slim 7 14 amd  ##  from offline retailer  ##  If you are looking for bang for the buck and are on a hunt to get a pc  ##  then below mentioned features are good about this - ####   The best laptop I've ever used. Feel is very pleasant - didn't get that even when working on a macbook. ####   Worst laptop from Lenovo- ####   This is definitely a good laptop. I bought it after ages and ages of comparisons. To me out seems great value for money ####   Great machine for daily use. I use this for office purpose. It works good with all my usual applications (MS Office ##  Outlook ##  MSP ##  CAD ##  Coreldraw ##  Photoshop ##  Sketchup etc....) ####   battery life is good almost 8 hrs ####   This laptop is wow. ####   Liked the dimension and weight. I use for heavy programming ##  teaching and entertainment. ####   Likes: ####   One of the best Ryzen ultrabook for the CPU but these companies know how to give garbage to indian customers. 8Gb RAM for the best ryzen 7 cpu? like seriously.. the target customers for this product is mostly business and productivity use and 8 gb ram these days are a base smartphone standard. On top of it ##  there is no upgradable ram option and you are committed to 8gb ram for life if you purchase this. Other countries has 16gb ram option for the same Slim 7 model and for a price way lesser than what they are selling here. ####   Build quality is amazing. Feels premium in hand. Looks premium as well. I sawsome reviews online and they all complained about the glossy screen.but the unit I got had matte screen. Talking of screen. It's very good.covers almost 100% srgb color gamut. Can be used for professional color related work. Battery lifegood. Especially paired with the lenovo vantage software whichis really useful. Keyboard is good. The face recognition is spot on. Works even in the dark. Haven't tried it in pitch black yet. Now let's talk about performance. The ryzen 7 4800u is a beqst of a mobile processor. But it's a Shame this usnit is shipped with only 8 gigabyte of ram. Basically making the overpowered cpu useless in some memory intensive tasks. You can edit videos on this as well. But that 8 gb ram really ruins the experience. Really wish it was upgradable. Or at least 16 gb. But anyways ## the SSD is fast and reliable. And also i've heard that you can install a second ssd in ryzen version. Haven't checked myself whether this unit is upgradable or not but if running into storage problems you can always use external storage solutions. You won't feel the difference if you went with the ryzen 5 version of this laptop ##  which i guess isn't available on Amazon but it might be in the market. The price online of this unit is fine ##  not overpriced but i think if you buy offline you'll have more options to look for cuz this laptop has aome other versions as well. And if you are thinking of buying this you can it really has no major problems except that little 8gb ram. But you may also consider the hp envy x360. It has ryzen 5 with non upgradable 8 gb ram. Which i guess would be better for 8 gb. Cuz your 8gb ram will limit the performance in heavy tasks. ####   Pros: ####   Been using for almost a month as my work laptop. ####   This Slim 7 with Ryzen 7 4800U - 8c/16T has been in other markets for so loong. Now when its finally available Lenovo puts just 8G basically making that i7 shaming 4800u basically useless. ####   It's full fill my need; the only complaint is RAM is not upgradable. ####   Unbilivable product at unbilivable price. I got more powerful product with higher CPU and GPU at lower price. Go for it.... ####   Best product and high performance. ####   Giving it a 4 star ##  as the CPU/APU and NVMe hardware is awesome for the price. ####   I wanted a new laptop for myself. My requirements were that it is lightweight and fast performance. Bought this laptop after quite some research. The laptop is very light and can be carried around easily. It has a Ryzen 7 Lastest Gen processor which is super duper fast. Booting takes less than 10 secs and with the IR camera ##  you are on the home screen in next to no time. The laptop has a very classy feel with an all metallic body. The display is awesome with good brightness and great viewing angles. The laptop also has front facing speakers so it's great for entertainment. All in all ##  it's been a great buy and I am very happy with the purchase. ####   Amazing product. Always been a fan of the yoga brand and this model is the epitome of it. Fast and thin and light. Great build quality and the Ryzen 7 processor is lightning speed fast."},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLG Gram Ultra-Light 11th Gen Core i7 ## 16 GB RAM ##  512 GB SSD ##  Win-10 ##  Iris Xe Graphics ##  16-inches (40.64 cms) ##  Thunderbolt 4 ##  USC -C x 2 (with Power) ##  1.19 kg ##  3 Yr Warranty (16Z90P-G.AH75A2 ##  Black)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹1 ## 45 ## 000.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹52 ## 710.00 (36%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": null, "about": "#Processor & OS: Intel 11th Gen Core i7-1165G7 (2.8 GHz ##  Turbo up to 4.7 GHz ##  L3 Cache 12MB ##  28W)- Window 10 # Display: 16\" (40.6 cm) WQXGA (2560 x 1600) 16:10 Aspect Ratio IPS Display with DCI-P3 99% # Memory: 16 GB LPDDR4X (Dual Channel-4266 MHz) # Storage: 512 GB SSD (Type:M.2 2280) NVMe with additional expansion slot # Product & Battery: Weight 1.19 Kg Magnesium Alloy - 80 Wh Battery with 16.5 hr back-up (* MobileMark 2018)##", "no_of_rating": "29 ratings", "avg_rating": "4.4", "total_no_answer": "\n20 answered questions\n", "delivery_type": "FREE delivery:", "delivery_date": "EMI", "Model": "16Z90P-G.AH75A2", "Brand": "LG", "SpecificUses": "Multimedia, Personal, Business", "ScreenSize": "16 Inches", "OS": "Windows 10 Home", "more_detail": "\nBrand\n#\n‎LG\n\n\nManufacturer\n#\n‎LG, NO.346, YAOXIN ROAD ECONOMIC & TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT ZONE, NANJING, 210038, PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA NANJING,China-210038\n\n\nSeries\n#\n‎16Z90P-G.AH75A2\n\n\nColour\n#\n‎Black\n\n\nForm Factor\n#\n‎Ultra-Portable\n\n\nItem Height\r\n\n#\n‎17 Millimeters\n\n\nItem Width\r\n\n#\n‎35.6 Centimeters\n\n\nStanding screen display size\n#\n‎16 Inches\n\n\nScreen Resolution\n#\n‎2560 x 1600 pixels\n\n\nResolution\n#\n‎1920 x 1080 Pixels\n\n\nProduct Dimensions\n#\n‎24.3 x 35.6 x 1.7 cm; 1.19 Kilograms\n\n\nBatteries\n#\n‎1 Lithium ion batteries required.

Hats off to R&D team. ####   Its superb ####   The laptop came in excellent package - the package itself spells the quality and care shown by the makers LG towards their product - unlike all those makers like ASUS or DELL ##  this one was premium. Everything was neat and clean. The pc is incredibly light - if you look at the photos you'll understand. It looks like a 13\" laptop ##  though it's 15 inches! ####   Ordered it a few days ago in the Amazon sale and got a great deal. Purchased it at 61k in Exchange for my lenovo."},{"name": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDell Inspiron 7415 14 inch FHD Touch Display 2in1 Laptop (R5 5500U / 8GB / 512GB SSD / Integrated Graphics / Win 10 + MSO / Backlit KB + FPR + Active Pen /Pebble Metal Color) D560470WIN9P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mrp": " ₹88 ## 627.00", "save": "\n\n\n\n₹18 ## 637.00 (21%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "price": "₹69 ## 990.00", "about": "#Free upgrade to Windows 11 when available.

Got stuck 2 times while doing simple tasks. ####   Don't buy. Comes with serious display issues ##  could no be resolved by dell or Microsoft. Worst image quality. Used it for 15 days and found the issue. Contacted dell and Microsoft ##  experts have suggested almost all troubleshooting steps upto the clean installation of windows ##  but the issue could not be resolved. ####   Beautiful product ##  works wonders. S pen results in ease of doing work. Fully folding n touch works smoothly. ####   You need to get a screen protection to avoid scratches while writting. ####   Pros: Hinge is perfect ##  battery backup is fine. Pen is pressure sensitive. ####   Dislike ####   Excellent build ####   Good and quality experience. The camera quality could be improved. Dell service is commendable ####   Camera quality. Not Good ####   I contacted dell for a 2-year warranty extension ##  they asked for Rs 7500 for the basic warranty. I pointed out that dell often sells it for Rs1499 ##  they said it's an offer that does not apply when you purchase the laptop from amazon. ####   Display issue ####    Agreed it has got poweful ryzen 5000 series. And ram upgradability. And greater build quality and premium. ####   So far the product looks very nice and as mentioned in product description all are received in good condition ##   touch screen is well responsive ##   screen resolution is FHD and satisfactory. Speaker sound is clear and crystal ##  am very much satisfied. Overall a very good package product with desent specification and can be used for all purpose.  Silver tone colour is so fascinating am loving it. Waiting people can go for it ##   no wory. ####   Reviewing after 3days of use: (I'm a freelance software developer and a startup founder- using this lap for development and customer support prospects) ####   This in continuation the previous review I posted about this product. ####   this laptop beat in the segment the screen quality is very good ####   This review is specifically against the exchange system. I ordered this Inspiron laptop from Amazon primarily for the good exchange offer on my old i3 laptop. The image attached is of the laptop to be exchanged. I read the terms and conditions that clearly stated that the laptop should  BOOT and NOT have any issues with Screen. However the delivery person went on to check the entirety of the old laptop including the keyboard ##  mouse and even shaked it vigorously for issues!!! So far so good. Now they find some small plastic has chipped out of the SD Card reader and rejects the entire laptop. When I said it's not acceptable as such a stringent criteria was not there in the Terms and Conditions he put me across to his Supervisor.  I protested stating that being an old laptop used and abused for years it is practically impossible to have it in pristine condition all around. The Terms and Conditions also spoke only about the key things like Battery ##  Bootable disk and Screen which were all fine in my case. I even suggested that they can deduct small amount for the plastic casing deformity. The Supervisor cooly advised me to pay the FULL BALANCE and keep the old laptop myself. Needless to state I was upset and refused to accept this type of dubious exchange scheme's and asked them to take back the new laptop. ####   Disappointing laptop. Has started hanging- it’s been 3 times in less than 2 weeks of purchase. And no heavy duty usage at all. Camera quality not good- images appear yellowish. Audio quality is average. ####   Please buy from a dell store  ##  do not fall for Rs. 1000 2000 cheaper ones . Mine started to stop charging on 6 th day   ##  amazon guys have taken it up for replacement  ##  but still the experience alltogether isn't  worth the price + the unconditional warranty thats also missing . Kudos to team amazon though for an apt timely response . ####   Item didn't switch ON on receipt. Took much struggling to get back paid money. Disappointed from seller ##  delivery and amazon. ####   Excellent performance ####   Build quality is good as well as the performance. ####   I received a broken laptop. Which o opened n my finger started eefinb. My nerves started psinknb ####   Pros: Trackpad ##  smooth and fast ##  Battery ####   For the ones who face the hanging issue ##  my personal suggestion is to reset it once ##  it will be absolutely perfect afterwards. ####   Frend camera is not available ####   Its the latest model laptop suitable for professional use. It also looks good and very flexible. ####   Pathetic camera 0.9 MP and touchpad also hanging frequently ##  You need to restart every time. Avoid this laptop if you can. ####   Good laptop for daily work and programming. Strong built and display. ####   Best in the price range ##  combines power ##  touch and utility in single package. Screen is very good ##  getting 10hrs of battery life ##  touch is very sensitive and active pen is icing on the cake.

This has hinges issues which will result into screen damage and other parts. Apart from this HP has highly disappointed post sales services. No value for money....You need to spend more money for getting it repair. I purchased this Laptop in Feb 2021 and Hinges came out in three months without any usages... ####   Happy with the purchase. Awesome product. ####   I am using this laptop since one week. Over-all I am satisfied. Heating problem is there couple of time while high data consumption. But performance of this laptop is too good. ####   display is awesome. size ##  weight ##  flexibility ##  battery  also good. ####   Never purchase a product with HP. Poor quality. I’ve bought my HP ENVY X360 by march. My laptop door got stuck while opening without even a hard handle. I have handled it very carefully each time i used my laptop. Now when i reach support they say that i damaged my laptop and it’s not claimable on warranty. They will rob your money like anything. Customer support is worst. I had a chat with HP support person named Abhishek ##  he kept on coping and pasting messages mentioning the same thing but at last they didn’t answer my question. ####   battery backup is not as clamed to be  ## it last upto 6-7 hrs ####   The laptop is actually good. But I have several issues with ssd and wifi keep on disconnecting. It happened after 20 days of purchase so return window has been closed. In 3 months I have formated my laptop 7 times. ##  ssd motherboard ##  and wifi card has already been changed ##  but still I am getting this problem. ####   An awesome buy!! everything works great!! stylus works very good and ia very responsive. good package by the seller!! loved the product!! ####   Very cute premium product.Works as advertised.Processor better than i5.Only small issue is screen is of  reflective type.Overall I am happy with the lappy.. ####   Right hinge broke after two months of gentle use. The broken hinge hit the screen and cracked it. After long calls and terrible service from HP ##  I was finally told I would have to pay 20k to get the laptop fixed and even though the laptop is under warranty ##  physical damage would not be covered by HP. If it wasn't for the hinge issue and the truly awful customer service by HP ##  I would have given this laptop 5 stars. But sorry to say ##  after this I will never be buying an HP laptop ####   The laptop is overall a great value just make sure you are purchasing the correct size as it seems little smaller if this laptop had a 14 inch display it would have been a perfect laptop ####   The hinge broke and screen is popping out within 3 months of use despite delicate handling. HP doesn't help with warranty claim as they consider it as accidental damage ##  which is not the case. It's the cheap build quality of the plastic used to stabilise the hinge. ####   ## The good. ####   The worst purchase I ever made. Was dead on arrival. ####   Specs are great but the quality seems to be bad. Having speaker issues within 10 days of buying a new laptop. HP service center agreed to change the speakers but even they are not sure if the issue is only due to the speakers. Customer Service is very poor and takes multiple calls to the customer care. This is my 2nd x360 only because the specs looked great and have an HP printer as well. Overall I would not recommend going for HP laptops/products. ####   It's delicate for use ##  battery life not up to the mark and definitely not for heavy task ####   For a simple Battery replacement they took 1 month and still not replaced. Please be careful prior making a buying decision. The HP service is not that effective and friendly. They will simply linger long without any quick resolution. Better try out for other brands like Lenovo/Dell who have 2 days prompt service policy. ####   Very good Laptop for creator ####   I think there is issue with speakers at some point it plays loud and automatically decreases to low I didn't understand where the problem is with speakers or software apart from this issue everything is good ####   Wireless adapter keep missing. Tried to update driver but no use. Only solution is to restart ####   Hinges came out within 3 months before my card emi ends.  Hinges broken on very smooth folding of 360 degrees.  It has very small support between the 2 parts ie ## m monitor and keyboard. ####   Overall ##  laptop is best in term of performance ##  specification ##  and user-friendly. The only problem ##  in table mode if laptop goes to sleep there is no way to wake up the laptop without flipping back to laptop. Although ##  there is an option with the help of digital pen to stick in the lower hing but didn't works everytime. Other than this ##  it's perfect. ####   Best ####   I have used it for a month now. The laptop is a gem. Its fast. Value for money. Touch is good. Great for people requiring two in one laptops. Overall experience is awesome. The only thing that is very average about this laptop is the HP pen and its built quality. Very mediocre built quality considering the price you pay for it. ####   Buy from store ##  costs 74k only ##  suggest you to buy from a store which is nearby. Great laptop thanks you ####    Oneof the best laptop u can buy with a good processor and graphic card... It's new era for RYZEN... byyy byy intel..must have for student ####   I  liked this product very much. It features are very attractive and useful.  the multi- functional. uses  like tablet and laptop is very nice.  The light weight and easily handle with touch screen is beautiful. ####   I've been using this laptop for the past 3 months. Actually ##  I was looking for a 13-inch windows laptop So I bought this ##  and to be honest this is a crazy laptop with good built quality and performance is bonkers. I've binge-watched series in this with external speakers and even used it for my online classes ##  photo editing ##  the battery is very sufficient ##  lasts around 13-14 hours solid. But in mine hinges ##  one side is slightly uneven than the other but they work absolutely fine. No issues so far. Best laptop. If you're looking for a cute ##  powerful ##  handy ##  and efficient laptop ##  go for the HP Envy x360 13 ay0045au. ####   Excellent laptop ####   A dream laptop for most of the people. Has all the specifications and an unmatched performance. ####   The laptop came without OS installed in it. It has major heating issue. You cannot operate for more than 15 mins on your lap. ####   It is a premium machine. Wish battery life was better ####   Ordered as a replacement for my 7 years old HP Pavilion model. This one rocks. Super viewing and listening experience. Form factor is the icing on the cake. Slim bezels. But ##  not suitable for phablet mode usage. Ideal pick for media consumption and ight excel works. Touch screen is not super responsive like it is in the mobile but decent job there too ####   Has a premium feel to it ##  it is compact and lightweight which helps. 3rd Gen Ryzen 5 processors are pretty good ##  rarely an application gets stuck. Serves well for general purpose laptop. Keypads are good ##  soft and easy to adapt. Found the speaker quality decent ##  has Bang & Olufsen speakers ##  quite decent for regular videos ##  don't expect anything fancy in this aspect. ####   Battery life is average we cannot say above average ##  you can play Fortnite ## pubg ##  cod mobile on ultra settings speakers are good ##  the keyboard is good ##  the trackpad is also good ##  the display is good ##  it is the laptop for not very high usage good for light users. When you play games laptop temp goes to 95 degrees celsius. This was shown by and Radeon software already built-in. Again not for heavy usage good for light usage like school work heavy usage like gaming. I bought it from the hp store ##  If you want to do gaming by omen at the same price if you won't use the touchscreen very much. A gaming laptop is better than it has vega 8 integrated graphics  4GB ##  8GB ram non-upgradable. It doesn't support type c charging also which is bad. Thanks! ####   Laptop is making very loud buzzing sound.. it is horrible ####   awesome laptop ##  power full ##  super display ##  nice touch response ##  good build and perfect for entertainment ##  with office work. ####   excellent laptop for students the stylus is nice ##  though the screen is a bit slippery for it. I had purchased it for a basic need but if you need to do graphic intensive work you can prefer HP omen or pavalion series. ####   Laptop is excellent and compact.Touch screen is good and Ryzen processor is much faster than Intel in my view.The network is not picking up sometimes rarely  & system needs a restart.Need to be fixed by HP .otherwise a good Laptop to buy ####   Guys be aware after receiving this  laptop when i checked warrenty online i was shocked because warrenty already started 6 month ago with someone else name so Be careful. ####   Amazing buy. Performance is beyond expectations. Boots up in 3/4 seconds and works without lag. This is expected from pc of this cost but this is beyond expectations. ####   Awesome. Premium in every way. ####   Good buy ####   Absolutely love this 2-in-1 laptop ##  though it cost me above ₹75k ####   A perfect device ####   There is an issue with the Speaker volume - it's inconsistent - probably because of a driver and Windows 10 update conflict. No solution found till now. ####   Great product. Sleek design. Long battery. Amazing styllus ## very light weight. Serves all purposes. Must have for teachers and professionals engaged in presentation ####   I have bought an HP envy x 360 laptop . The serial # of my laptop is CNDO3946SG . I faced an issue with the laptop . The internal speakers stopped working all of a sudden. I called customer support  ##  they troubleshoot it and they said that the technician will be sent to my place  ##  who will fix the problem. After a week I was informed that technician will visit to your place . The technician came and suggested that it is not a hardware issue  ## it is an operating system issue . I was told another technician will visit my place on priority basis as I have waited for a long time. I was assured a technician will visit to my place within 48 hours and he will fix this problem. After waiting for more than a stipulated time ##  I called the customer service to inform them that the. Technician hasn’t visited my place yet and I was waiting for a long time  ##  please resolve this issue as soon as possible. I was informed  that the case has been closed and I was shocked how can they close the case without any communication from them . I called again and I was informed that they can’t help me . I wonder what kind of on-site warranty your company provides to customers . When we need the on-site service we are being delayed and denied . I request you kind take your laptop back and refund me my money so that I will buy a laptop from some good service provider . I am having a worst experience with HP . I will never recommend any of my friends or colleagues to buy anything from HP. I will give my reviews on every social media platforms and I will make sure no other customer suffers as I have. ####   Components and premium  ##  laptop and lightweight and compact. ####   Screen resolution and clarity : superb ####   Great product. Positives: sturdy ##  sleek ##  elegant ##  backlit keyboard ##  touchscreen (with/without stylus) ##  360 degree rotation ##  great battery life ##  strategic positions of speakers. Negatives: definitely overpriced considering the small screen size and AMD processor ####   I am writing this after usage of around two months. So far I am a very satisfied customer. I was initially skeptical about AMD Ryzen but now I can say it is better than intel (on feel factor basis ##  have not done any tests). What do I use it for - browsing (with 10+ tabs and cloud based business Apps running in parallel) ##  Video calls over Teams and Zoom (both video and sound quality is pretty good) ##  office applications (multiple word ##  excel and power point documents remain in open state). key board and touch pad is very smooth and convenient (have pretty thick fingers). Get 8+ hours of battery backup though not tested the limits. ####   This is just excellent product ####   The pen from HP is no where near apple pencil. ####   Like: light laptop for everyday use. Good features intended for creativity with spectacular display. No issues with programming as well; I've used it for coding and image analysis. ####   Laptop is good.. But I got a model whose warranty was registered with 2 month's back start date. That means I have received an old model or an used one whose serial is already being registered on the site ####   This is one good purchase ##  provides decent speed ##  touch screen is smooth ##  bit disappointed with battery ##  with full on usage it at max goes good for 4 hours ####   I think purchasing these product is bettee in offline.i received a damaged product by default ie a dead pixel on the screen and a broken key on the keyboard. Didn't expect to get a too low quality laptop from a brand like hp and sold by Amazon ####   Verry good backup ##  touch is more speed ####   HP Envy x360 user of 4 months. ####   Overall this is a fine product ##  Been using it for the past 15 days turned out really well ####   Purchased this expensive machine only to see that the screen died the very next day. Disappointed ... very disappointed as now I will have to go after all the HP service centre guys to see that it is repaired. ####   Posting the review after using the laptop for 2 months. I am a light user ##  so the battery life is great (~8 hours). The touch screen works amazing. The look and feel of the laptop is elegant. Overall ##  a great purchase for me. ####   Simply Awesome ####   Amazon laptop!!! ####   This ultra book is worthy for its price ####   DO NOT buy this laptop ##  although the whole body is aluminium  ##  but internally where the hinges are screwed to the body ##  that joint is made of plastic. On a fully metal laptop ##  it just makes no sense to do that. It's just a cheap tactic used by the company to reduce the life span of the product so people get it replaced faster and spend more money. ####   Certainly Mind-blowing in all aspects at such a feasible cost ####   Hinge came out within 2 months - with just regular use and no impact one fine day one of the hinge broke apart ... looks like a premium laptop but build wise i have doubts not... ####   I bought this so called premium line from HP just two days back... As I started using it for my business video meetings ##  encountered two big issues: ####   Sleek and beautiful. Got it for my wife. She's loving it. Envy is the perfect name because it's exactly how people who own MacBooks feel when they see it and hear the price. ####   Except the pen ##  rest is value for money ####   one of the best laptops i had used  ## it is beautiful in every way i bought on friends advice but after working for two days love it ####   I was looking for a light weight laptop with small touch screen so that I can use it like a tab this is the only laptop matching my requirements under my budget (<80k). ####   The stylus is not working fake stylus ####   Everything is perfect when it comes to the product. Go for it blindly. But price keep fluctuating for this product. I paid around 80k ##  within days its about 77k. It could go down as low as 73k with bank discount offers during festive seasons. I feel cheated by the seller for this high price hence only four star. Buy only when you get good discount offers. Don't be impatient like me. ####   I recently purchased this laptop from Croma during the annual fest after thorough research and I must say that I wasted time in researching and getting confused. ####    Best laptop for students and professionals as well . The HP Envy x360 13 is an excellent small two-in-one with a higher-end design than you'd typically get at this price -- assuming you can find one in stock. Factor in the solid AMD performance and battery life and it's an easy recommendation .and taking about processor (b/w ENVY and PAVILION) ####   Extremely happy with the purchase as the laptop is very light and fast. Except camera which is average everything else is just too amazing. ####   Great ####   Great light convertible. Thin and easy to use. Big illuminated keys. Fast and easy on the eyes with adjusted brightness. Enjoying the experience ####   Very Good Product ####   Nice lapy... ####   TL;DR - ####   This laptop I have been using for more than a month now and I am fully satisfied with the performance. Its really fast while booting up and has a really nice keyboard and is light and portable. ####   I had always wanted to get myself a high processing and high utility laptop ##  and this was my first big purchase ever. ####   Value for money...can be used as a tablet or Pad ##  the pen is marvelous ####   A great laptop for scientific research programmes and simulations. Fast start and excellent processing speed. great sound and excellent graphics. good value for money. ####   PROs: ####   Love this laptop jst close ur eyes and go for it 😍 awesome features and look is also so premium"}]
